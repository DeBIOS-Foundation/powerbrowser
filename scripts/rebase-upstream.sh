# D-74/D-77: the one documented command that moves the fork onto a new ESR
# tag. Composes scripts/fetch-upstream.sh (re-materialize + D-76 classifier)
# and scripts/apply-patches.sh (replay + D-75 non-vacuous per-patch
# assertion), then gates on scripts/check-patch-surface.sh before reporting
# success. It never reimplements the replay or the fail-loud behaviour --
# those live in the two composed scripts (D-74: upstream/ is fully
# disposable, patches/ is the single source of truth).
#
# The real (non-dry-run) path removes and re-clones upstream/, so per this
# plan's shared-state rule it is exercised locally only via --dry-run; its
# first real run is the CI dispatch (plan 03-06).

# pattern, where it was a BRE. `--tag '*'` satisfied both -- it listed every tag
# and matched `refs/tags/*` as a regex -- so validation passed and the run went
# on to `rm -rf "$UPSTREAM_DIR"` before failing inside `git clone --branch '*'`.
# There is no command injection here (every use is quoted and `--branch`
# consumes its value positionally); the defect is that the step meant to catch a

# exits 141; `set -o pipefail` propagates that as the pipeline's status, `if !`
# inverts it, and the script reports a tag that exists as missing --
# non-deterministically, at the first gate of a 40-minute operation. `|| true`
# keeps the capture from tripping `set -e`: a genuinely absent tag is an empty
# capture, which the match below rejects with the message it deserves.
#
# `-F` (WR-07) matches the ref as a literal, not as a BRE, so a `.` in a tag
# name cannot match a near-miss neighbour and report a typo as valid.

# D-18: the residual-brand scan is a PERMANENT gate from Phase 1 onward, not a
# one-shot migration check. It runs here because a rebase is the one routine
# operation that pulls in content nobody in this repo wrote, and a patch that
# replays cleanly can still reintroduce a stale brand string. Static and
# no-build, so it costs nothing next to the replay it follows.
#
# (Deliberately not spelling the old brand token in this comment: it lives in
# the scanned scope, so naming the literal here would make this file fail the
# very gate it invokes. The scan caught exactly that when this block was first
# written -- the inventory is the place that spells the tokens out.)
#
# Run with NO exception. Plan 01-03 hand-wrote the surfaces the codemod was
# forbidden to touch, so --except-hand-write was dropped here the moment the
# bare scan went green -- an exception that outlives the plan it was cut for is
# how a gate quietly stops being one.
#
# --extra-root "$UPSTREAM_DIR" is the CR-B correction (plan 01-15). The scan's
# ordinary file set is `git ls-files`, and .gitignore excludes upstream/, so
# until this argument was passed the invocation right here -- the one whose
# entire stated purpose is re-checking the tree the replay just rewrote -- read
# only the same tracked files the pre-replay scan had already read, and none of
# the replayed tree at all. --extra-root walks that tree from the filesystem
# under the same inventory filters, and fails loudly if it is missing or empty
# rather than skipping.
