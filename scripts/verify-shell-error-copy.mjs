// shell-error-copy-no-internals (01-07).
//
// Asserts that no internal identifier can reach #powerbrowser-error-message --
// the full-screen text a user is looking at when the pointer-driven happy path
// has already failed. Before 01-07 that element was painted with strings like
// `powerbrowser.sidecar.backendMain (/x/y) does not exist` and `Backend did not
// announce POWERBROWSER_BACKEND_READY within 90000ms.`; a pure rename would
// have prefixed the leak with a new product name and shipped it.
//
// HOW IT ASSERTS, and why it is not a banned-literal list. It DERIVES, from
// TheiaService.sys.mjs at check time:
//
//   1. the USER_MESSAGE table's declared keys and their string values;
//   2. every `USER_MESSAGE.<key>` reference in the file;
//   3. every `message:` property value in the file;
//   4. every `this._showError(...)` call's first argument, checked against a
//      set of message-bearing bindings ALSO derived from the file -- see the
//      note on rule (4) below.
//
// and then compares those derived sets. A hand-kept list of forbidden strings
// can only ever agree with the tree it was written from; these comparisons go
// red on an ADDED leak, an ad-hoc literal that bypasses the table, a STALE
// declared-but-unreferenced entry, and a REMOVED entry that is still
// referenced. The leak test itself is a SHAPE test -- an all-caps underscored
// token of four or more characters, or a dotted key of three or more segments
// -- so a failure path added next year is covered without touching this file.
//
// RULE (4), and why 01-14 rewrote it. It used to accept any `<x>.message`
// argument, on the stated grounds that checks (1)-(3) "prove" such a value is
// table-derived. They do not: they constrain `message:` PROPERTY DECLARATION
// sites and say nothing about the identifier bound at a CALL site. A caught
// exception's `.message` -- the runtime's own text, carrying paths, ports and
// errno strings, and the exact shape this rule exists to catch -- matched that
// alternative and sailed through into full-screen user-facing copy. Rule (4)
// now binds to `messageBearingBindings()`, a set DERIVED from the file under
// test; every other `<x>.message` is rejected by name. A rename of a binding,
// an added call site or a removed one changes what the checker COMPUTES rather
// than requiring this file to be edited.
//
// RULE (4) therefore checks TWO things. That every ENUMERATED call site takes a
// table-derived message (01-14), and -- since 01-16, CR-03 -- that the
// ENUMERATION ITSELF IS COMPLETE: the number of `_showError(` call sites the
// enumeration regex parsed is compared against a second, independently derived
// total, and a disagreement is a loud failure. An accept rule applied to a
// silently incomplete set of sites can go green on the one site it never saw.
//
// Static on purpose: it reads the source, needs no build, no browser and no
// display, and therefore belongs in --quick where a leak costs seconds rather
// than a forty-minute rebuild. Its runtime counterpart is verify-platform.sh's
// shell-diagnostics-rows-populated, which drives two real failure paths and
// asserts the painted message is one of the values derived here.
//
// Usage:
//   node scripts/verify-shell-error-copy.mjs [--file <path>]
//   node scripts/verify-shell-error-copy.mjs --self-test
//
// Exit 0 pass, 1 fail. --self-test plants every fault in the FAULTS array below
// into a temporary copy and requires each to go red naming the drift; a check
// that can only go green is not a check.
