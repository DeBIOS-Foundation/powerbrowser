// CUST-01's inertness proof: pixel comparison across three states of the
// same RUNNING page:
//   1. no `customize.css` present
//   2. an empty `customize.css` present
//   3. a `customize.css` containing one high-specificity rule with an
//      unmistakable effect
// States 1 and 2 must compare equal -- that is the inertness claim. State 3
// must differ from state 1 -- that is the hot-reload claim, and without it
// the inertness assertion would also pass against a layer that does
// nothing at all (an inert-because-broken layer must not pass).
//
// -- Step 0 (D-69's one open detail; settled empirically this session,
// 2026-08-20/21, not assumed) --
// Two captures of the SAME unchanged page are byte-identical PROVIDED they
// come from the same live BiDi session (`withFirefoxPage`'s `screenshot()`,
// `browsingContext.captureScreenshot` against the page already loaded and
// settled) -- confirmed by hashing repeated captures spaced 2-3s apart:
// identical SHA-256 every time. Byte-hashing is therefore safe on this
// host and this is branch one of D-69's fork (`node:crypto`, no image
// library, no python3 needed).
//
// That safety is conditional on the capture MECHANISM, which is itself a
// load-bearing finding: Plan 02's sibling `captureScreenshot` export
// (`--headless --screenshot`, a one-shot "load and screenshot" process
// launch with no scripting hook) was tried first and found unusable for
// this purpose -- it fires on the page's early `load` event, well before
// a Theia SPA's `startContributions()`/shell-attach sequence completes, so
// every capture it produced was a near-blank loading screen (~99.9% white
// pixels, sampled) regardless of what `customize.css` said, and repeated
// captures of that same near-blank state were NOT byte-identical (a small,
// stable, text-shaped region -- font-rasterization jitter across separate
// process launches -- differed run to run). Neither symptom reproduces
// with `withFirefoxPage`'s `screenshot()`: it runs inside the session
// `waitFor` already uses, so this script waits for `#theia-app-shell` (and
// settles past the CSS layer's debounce) before every capture, and reuses
// one Firefox process/page across all three states rather than relaunching
// per state -- which also makes this script a truer test of D-59/D-60's
// actual hot-reload claim (one running page, the file changing under it)
// than three independent fresh boots would have been.
// `scripts/lib/firefox-bidi.mjs` gained the `screenshot()` capability for
// this reason; see its own header for the mechanism note.
//
// No `import`/`require` of any package name (D-69): only Node built-ins
// and `scripts/lib/firefox-bidi.mjs`.
