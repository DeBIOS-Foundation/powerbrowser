/**
 * GUI-02's in-shell web tab, PROVEN BY OBSERVATION in the built shell
 * (14.1-01 tracer; 14.1-03 v2: the whole contract).
 *
 * The overlay bridge has no bare-Node observable: the placeholder is a Theia
 * widget in a live frontend, the page is a chrome-owned <xul:browser> in the
 * shell window, and the only thing that joins them is the PowerBrowserGroup
 * actor channel inside the built binary. Every static gate in the tree reads
 * text; this file drives the real product and looks at the real contexts.
 *
 * WHAT IT DRIVES -- Chris's own sequence, through the product's own paths:
 *   1. the chrome bar's New Tab command ("+");
 *   2. a typed address committed with Enter in the pill (React-compatible
 *      value write + `input` event, then a `keydown` Enter);
 *   3. a second typed address, which must navigate the SAME overlay;
 *   3b. the overlay dropped from under the widget (chrome asked to close the
 *      tab while the placeholder stays open, which is what a chrome-side
 *      restart leaves behind), then ONE Reload;
 *   4. the mode walk Coding -> Browsing -> Organising -> Browsing -> Coding,
 *      derived from mode-descriptors.ts in source order, through the modes
 *      activate command (second visits included);
 *   5. the chrome-side tab store, read through the frontend's own
 *      ChromeBarSuggestionService (a reader independent of the writer);
 *   5b. thumbnail attribution: the overlay navigated to a THIRD served page
 *      whose response is written but never ended -- the document commits and
 *      paints while the network never reaches STOP, so the on-load capture arm
 *      cannot fire for it -- and then hidden through the product's own
 *      geometry message, leaving the last-view arm of `webTabGeometry`
 *      (PowerBrowserAPI.sys.mjs:2358-2365) as the only site that can account
 *      for the snapshot the row ends up carrying;
 *   6. the tab's close glyph (`widget.close()`).
 *
 * WHAT IT ASSERTS, each a named failure: zero `window.open` calls; exactly
 * one new main-area title from the web-tab factory, focused pill, "New Tab"
 * label; the overlay is a SECOND top-level BiDi context carrying the served
 * URL whose screen rect (`mozInnerScreenX/Y`, `innerWidth/Height`, read
 * INSIDE the overlay with `evaluateIn`) equals the placeholder's screen rect
 * within 1 CSS px on all four edges; the second commit changes that same
 * context's URL (id unchanged); the pill equals chrome's canonical URL and
 * `uriOf(widget)` equals the overlay's live URL; Back is disabled after the
 * first commit and enabled after the second; the tab stays attached and in
 * the main area across every hop, realigned wherever it is current and
 * hidden (`document.hidden` in the overlay) wherever it is not; a store row
 * a dropped overlay puts the shipped lost-view copy in the tab body with no
 * user action and ONE Reload brings the page back aligned (G-14.1.1-4 -- made
 * non-vacuous by the clean control passing all three while the
 * `lost-view-ignored` plant, which restores the discarded geometry reply,
 * fails them); a web tab described under a FOREIGN session's id is refused by
 * the same `WidgetFactory` seam the stock layout restorer calls, and a second
 * "+" mints an id distinct from the first (G-14.1.1-5); a store row
 * for the served URL is readable after navigation and gone after close; four
 * thumbnail assertions in the order the attribution runs -- the row for the
 * hanging page carries NO snapshot before the hide, then carries one, that
 * snapshot is a PNG data URL, and its length is inside the capture cap derived
 * from the boundary file (G-14.1.1-6); that evidence is ATTRIBUTABLE because
 * the hanging page never reaches network STOP, so the hide is the only capture
 * opportunity its row ever had. The residual limitation, stated rather than
 * implied: no plant in this file can edit chrome-side source -- every plant
 * runs in the page realm -- so `hide-not-published` removes the FRONTEND half
 * of that one causal chain, and deleting the chrome-side last-view arm at
 * PowerBrowserAPI.sys.mjs:2358-2365 produces the same three reds, which is the
 * property G-14.1.1-6 asks for. Also: no
 * context carries a served URL after close; the main-area id set after close
 * equals the set before "+"; the shell's own POWERBROWSER_SHELL_READY line
 * is PRESENT in the launched binary's stdout (never an absence assertion).
 *
 * NO HEADLESS COMPENSATION (G-14.1.1-20): nothing in this check helps the
 * chrome bar learn which tab is selected, and that is deliberate. The pill
 * assertion stands on the strip-selection binding alone --
 * `shell.mainPanel.onDidChangeCurrent` in chrome-bar-widget.tsx -- so a
 * regression that re-keys the pill on DOM focus of the placeholder goes red
 * here rather than being propped up into looking correct. The
 * `focus-keyed-pill` plant is what proves that red is reachable. Per-hop
 * currency is read from the main dock's `currentTitle` (Lumino state), as v1
 * did.
 *
 * WHAT IT DERIVES, never hand-keeps: factory id, empty-page URL, state event
 * name, the three class names and the DI binding line from web-tab.ts and
 * the frontend module; the New Tab command id and the pill input class from
 * chrome-bar-commands.ts; the shipped mode ids (exactly three), the activate
 * command id and the organising widget id from the modes extension. A zero
 * derivation is a named FAIL (broken instrument), never a skip.
 *
 * The served pages come from a `node:http` server this script starts on an
 * ephemeral loopback port, so no fixture host on the network is involved and
 * the URL the overlay must carry is known exactly.
 *
 * HONESTLY TIERED -- THIS CANNOT BE `--quick`. It launches the built
 * `objdir/dist/bin/powerbrowser` headless over WebDriver BiDi and needs the
 * last Theia app build (fresh profile, so chrome-side edits are live, but the
 * frontend bundle is whatever `theia build` last wrote). Register it in the
 * full set, never the commit gate. One clean run is roughly a minute;
 * `--self-test` boots thirteen sessions (the clean control plus twelve plants).
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/verify-web-tab-live.mjs
 *   node scripts/verify-web-tab-live.mjs --self-test
 *   node scripts/verify-web-tab-live.mjs --help
 *
 * No import of any package name -- Node built-ins and scripts/lib/firefox-bidi.mjs
 * only (D-69).

/**
 * FAILURE-MESSAGE FAMILIES (G-14.1.1-20). Every assertion message -- both the
 * ones pushed inside `runProtocol`'s phases and the ones pushed here -- begins
 * with exactly one of these fifteen tokens, and the token is the FIRST thing in
 * the message:
 *
 *   newtab:     what "+" added -- title count, factory id, label, pill focus,
 *               pill emptiness, dock currency, and the no-widget case
 *   popup:      the window.open call count
 *   context:    top-level browsing-context identity and count for the overlay
 *   align:      the overlay-versus-placeholder rect comparison (the contract
 *               assertion); its no-pair-measured guard is a broken-instrument
 *               report, which the scorer will not credit
 *   nav:        navigating the same context in place, uriOf vs the live URL,
 *               Back enablement after each commit
 *   pill:       the pill's value after each commit (the chrome bar's binding)
 *   push:       state only a chrome push can supply (the widget's own strip label)
 *   dropdown:   the commit issued inside the suggestion debounce window
 *   lost-view:  the overlay dropped from under the widget, and the one Reload
 *   walk:       the mode walk -- hop records, attachment, main-area membership,
 *               the no-realignment guard, the organising slot
 *   restore:    the foreign-id construction and the minted-id distinctness
 *   store:      the store row readable after navigation
 *   thumbnail:  the last-view snapshot attribution
 *   close:      rows, contexts and main-area id residue after close
 *   shell:      the POWERBROWSER_SHELL_READY line in the binary's stdout
 *
 * WHY: `--self-test` scores each plant by an ANCHORED PREFIX (startsWith), so a
 * plant can only ever be credited with the family it names. A bare-substring
 * expect could be satisfied by any message that happened to contain the word --
 * which is exactly the defect this closed set exists to make impossible.
 *
 * NOT in the set, deliberately: the derivation failures (they lead with the file
 * path they name and run before any plant), a plant that could not be applied,
 * and a phase that threw. Those three report a BROKEN INSTRUMENT rather than a
 * contract, they are caught by their own checks in `selfTest`, and no plant may
 * be scored on them.
 *
 * The same rule covers the five in-family guards that begin with a scoring
 * prefix (`lost-view:`, `thumbnail:` twice, `walk:`, `align:`) and end with
 * BROKEN_INSTRUMENT_MARKER: they say the instrument could not assert, not that
 * the contract failed. Since 14.1.1-14 this is ENFORCED by the scorer rather
 * than only asserted here -- a message carrying the marker scores nothing, and
 * a case whose only messages in its family carry it fails naming that fact.
 *
 * UNPLANTED FAMILIES, stated rather than left to derive (14.1.1-14). Each is a
 * known limitation with its reason, not an omission:
 *   nav:, walk:  a plant would have to be keyed on the modes extension's
 *                runtime shape, and mode-service.ts, group-actor-client.ts and
 *                main-area-exemption.ts were held uncommitted by a concurrent
 *                session when the other plants were added, so such a plant
 *                would have been scored against code that pass could not see.
 *                Plant them from a quiet tree.
 *   shell:       asserts that the LAUNCHED BINARY printed its ready sentinel
 *                to stdout. Every plant in this file runs in the page realm,
 *                so no plant here can suppress it.
 *
 * Tree-side assertions over one live report. @returns {string[]}
