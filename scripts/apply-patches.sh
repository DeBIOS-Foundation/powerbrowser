# D-74/D-75: replays patches/*.patch onto upstream/ in glob (zero-padded
# numeric prefix) order. Safely re-runnable: a second run over an
# already-applied stack fails by patch name rather than reporting success.
#
# git apply --3way was empirically measured (03-RESEARCH.md, D-75 experiment)
# to exit 0 with a completely silent no-op on already-adopted content -- the
# before/after blob-hash comparison below is the only mechanism that catches
# that silent drop. --3way (not plain `git apply`) is used because plain
# `git apply` fails on legitimate upstream drift a 3-way merge would resolve.
#
# --self-test (03-02 Task 3) proves the assertion actually goes red, without
# touching upstream/ or patches/ and without a 1.1 GB clone: reverse-applies
# the real 010-sourcerer-identity.patch against a COPY of the real (already-
# patched) upstream file to derive a byte-identical pre-patch fixture --
# byte-identical is what matters here, because it makes the fixture's blob
# hash equal the patch's own "before" index hash, which is what lets the
# second `git apply --3way` below perform a genuine 3-way merge (silent
# no-op) instead of falling back to a plain non-3-way apply (a real conflict,
# which would prove nothing about D-75's actual failure mode).
