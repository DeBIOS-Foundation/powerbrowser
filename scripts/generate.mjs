//
// WHAT IT COVERS. Fifty-two targets: thirty-three byte-identical to the
// file Phase 1 wrote by hand -- the five Phase 2 build surfaces (the two
// branding configure.sh files, .mozconfig, and the two .desktop files), the
// eighteen GEN-01 branding-directory surfaces (per variant: brand.ftl,
// brand.properties, moz.build, content/jar.mn, content/moz.build,
// locales/jar.mn, locales/moz.build, content/aboutDialog.css and
// pref/firefox-branding.js), and the ten GEN-02 icon rasters (per variant:
// default16/32/48/64/128.png, drawn from the single brand/mark.svg through
// the system inkscape) -- plus the four GEN-02 containers (per variant:
// firefox.ico and firefox.icns, wrapped from those same rasters by pure-Node
// writers) and the eight GEN-03 installer fields (per variant:
// branding.nsi, firefox.VisualElementsManifest.xml, installer
// AppxManifest-fields.xml and Info-plist-fields.xml), plus the GEN-01
// identity carrier (generated/identity.configure: the vendor/UA lines plus
// the two fixed telemetry-policy lines patch 010 used to hard-code,
// pulled in by its include hook), plus
// the GEN-05 Theia frontend-config fragment
// (generated/theia-frontend-config.json: the brand-owned upstream keys of
// the application package.json's theia.frontend.config block --
// applicationName and defaultTheme), plus the GEN-05 Theia branding
// fragment (generated/theia-branding.json: the powerbrowserBranding key of
// that same block -- welcome/about texts, the in-app repo URL, the mark
// SVG, and the three About-dialog legal notices (06-04)), plus the TEL-01/TEL-02 telemetry fragment
// (generated/theia-telemetry.json: the powerbrowserTelemetry key of that
// same block -- level and endpoint), plus the TEL-03 endpoint-hosts
// fragment (generated/endpoint-hosts.json: the sorted hosts of the
// manifest telemetry endpoint, the [urls] values and the support URL),
// plus the EXT-01 declared-extensions map
// (generated/theia-plugins.json: the application package.json's theiaPlugins
// block, one exact download URL per [[extensions]] entry -- a versioned
// Open VSX file URL for source = "openvsx", the stated URL verbatim for
// source = "url"), plus the UPD-01 pin fragment
// (generated/upstream-pins.env: the [upstreams] tag as one shell
// assignment, sourced by scripts/fetch-upstream.sh as its default).
// That byte-identity IS
// the acceptance test for the thirty-three,
// which is why no emitter here is allowed to reformat, reorder or "tidy" what
// it reproduces; the four containers, the eight installer fragments and the
// identity carrier have no hand-written originals and are structurally
// checked instead.
//
// WHY THE PIPELINE ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING. Parse, then reject unknown settings,
// then mask, then merge, then validate, then emit, then write -- in that order
// and no other:
//
//  * Unknown-setting rejection runs BEFORE anything is merged or assigned. A
//    merge over an unchecked document assigns by computed key, and a reserved
//    key name reaches the prototype chain that way. Rejecting first means such
//    a name never reaches an assignment at all.
//  * Masking runs BEFORE the merge and on the defaults layer OBJECT, never on
//    the merged result. The two orderings agree on the wholly-absent case and
//    disagree on the PARTIAL case -- a downstream that sets some identity keys
//    and omits others -- and the partial case is the one that actually ships.
//  * Unknown-setting rejection also runs before the required-setting check, so
//    a misspelled section header is reported as the misspelling it is, rather
//    than as five separate complaints about the correctly-spelled settings it
//    shadowed.
//  * Nothing is written under generated/ until every check has passed. A failed
//    run leaves the output tree exactly as it found it.
//
// TWO COPY RULES THIS FILE OBEYS BY CONSTRUCTION (D-11, and CLAUDE.md's
// user-facing copy section). First, the parser's own error text is never
// printed: it embeds a caret diagram and parser vocabulary, so the caught error
// is re-emitted from its structured line and column fields alone. Second, every
// failure line names a setting by the dotted path a reader can find in
// configuration.toml, states the rule in plain words, and ends with a real next
// step. No stack trace, no internal variable name, no host path.
//
// ENCODING. The unset test is a plain JS code-unit trim and comparisons are
// byte-level over UTF-8. No Unicode normalisation is applied anywhere in this
// file: two values differing only in normalisation form are different values,
// and silently folding them would make a rebrand that looks right produce bytes
// that are not.
//
// The repo root is derived from this file's own location, never from the
// working directory -- scripts/verify-platform.sh invokes every check with
// absolute paths. The desktop-entry emitter carries a placeholder token in
// place of that root (see emitDesktopEntry): no emitted byte may depend on
// where this checkout happens to live.
//
// Usage:
//   node scripts/generate.mjs
//   node scripts/generate.mjs --check
//   node scripts/generate.mjs --self-test

/**
 * The required-setting check for the elements of the `[[extensions]] array,

 * the conditional pins.
 *
 * WHY A SECOND LOOP (same reason as validateVariantElements). `extensions[].id`
 * is one setting per element and readPath cannot address any of them.
 *
 * WHY EVERY FAILURE NAMES THE ENTRY ID. The generic regex loop below reports a
 * dotted path, and `extensions[].sha256` does not say WHICH of several
 * entries is unpinned or malformed. Every failure here names the entry's id
 * (or its ordinal where the id itself is what is missing), so a manifest with
 * five entries fails on the one that is wrong.
 *
 * CONDITIONAL PINS. `version` is required when source is `openvsx` (it builds
 * the exact versioned file URL -- latest-resolution is the unpinned behavior
 * EXT-01 forbids) and `url` is required when source is `url`. Both carry
 * `required: false` in the schema so this function, which sees the source, is
 * the only place that demands them; `id`, `source` and `sha256` carry
 * `required: true` and are enforced by the loop below exactly like the variant
 * elements above. A `url` that stock `theia download:plugins` would refuse
 * (anything not ending in .vsix/.theia/.tar.gz) fails HERE, at generate time,
 * rather than after the download step -- same entry-naming shape.
 *
 * SHAPES ARE DERIVED, NOT RESTATED. Each value is tested against its own
 * schema `regex`, read out of SCHEMA_KEYS, so the pattern lives in exactly
 * one place. The generic regex loop skips `extensions[].*` paths for the same
 * reason: one value, one failure, naming the entry.

/**
 * The root .mozconfig: the shared generated-from banner, a blank line, then
 * eleven lines against the file Phase 1 wrote by hand.
 *
 * FOUR VALUES come from the manifest: the --with-app-basename argument, the
 * --with-distribution-id argument, the exported MOZ_APP_REMOTINGNAME, and --
 * inside the MOZ_OBJDIR shell-default expansion on line 1 -- the variant's
 * objdir.
 *
 * THE --with-branding DEFAULT IS A STRING LITERAL, NOT A FIFTH VALUE. The
 * 03-01 spike proved a branding path outside topsrcdir is rejected -- the
 * moz.build sandbox refuses files outside its allowed paths -- so the flag
 * points through the topsrcdir-internal symlink
 * powerbrowser/branding-generated (itself pointing at generated/branding),
 * with the dev variant as the default a release build overrides via
 * POWERBROWSER_BRANDING. The symlink sits one level above the per-variant
 * directories it serves rather than inside powerbrowser/branding/: the
 * --with-branding VALUE must sit exactly three levels under topsrcdir,
 * because the branding moz.build reaches upstream with a ../../../ include
 * resolved against that value's own path. A link one level deeper puts the
 * value at depth four and the include escapes topsrcdir -- proven red by a
 * configure run during this plan. That spelling was chosen by configure
 * runs, not by a manifest key, and T-03-03 keeps it that way: no manifest
 * value may select the branding flag, so this line joins nothing from the
 * config.
 *
 * WHY THE DEV VARIANT, ALWAYS. There is one .mozconfig, and the two expansions
 * spell out what the build falls back on when POWERBROWSER_OBJDIR and
 * POWERBROWSER_BRANDING are unset. Those fallbacks are the DEV defaults; a
 * release build sets the two environment variables. So this emitter takes the
 * dev variant not as a default that could reasonably be parameterised, but
 * because dev IS what an unset environment means here.
 *
 * WHY THE ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE NAMES STAY LITERAL. POWERBROWSER_OBJDIR and
 * POWERBROWSER_BRANDING are read by scripts and by the developer's shell, not
 * written by this phase; renaming them is not a rebrand operation and no
 * manifest key selects them. Their VALUES are configurable; their NAMES are
 * part of the build's interface.
 *
 * WHY SIX LINES ARE LITERAL TEXT (research assumption A3, and a recorded
 * decision rather than an oversight). Lines 2-5 and 8-9 are toolchain and
 * feature flags -- the application selection, the updater, the wasm sandbox,
 * the libclang path, the crash reporter, the compiler cache. None of them is a
 * rebrand input: changing a brand never changes whether the crash reporter is
 * built. Promoting one to a [build] key later is purely additive -- one schema
 * entry and one emitter line -- so the cheap direction is to leave them literal
 * until a downstream actually needs to differ.
 *
 * Built by concatenation rather than by template interpolation on the two
 * expansion lines: `${...}` inside a JS template literal is JS interpolation,
 * and the shell-default syntax has to survive to the emitted bytes intact.

 * The Gecko identity carrier (03-04, GEN-01 close-out; 05-01 hook-only
 * strip): the vendor/UA project_flag values plus the two telemetry-policy
 * flags patch 010 used to hard-code, emitted as imply_option lines for the
 * build to include.
 *
 * WHY AN INCLUDE, NOT MOZCONFIG EXPORTS. MOZ_APP_VENDOR and MOZ_APP_UA_NAME
 * are project_flag() values, whose template pins possible_origins to
 * ("implied",) -- only imply_option inside a moz.configure file can set
 * them. A mozconfig export line is the environment origin and configure
 * rejects it ("can not be set by environment. Values are accepted from:
 * implied", proven red by a forced configure during this plan). So the
 * carrier is a generated moz.configure fragment, pulled into the build by
 * the single include() hook patch 010 carries.
 *
 * FIXED VS CONFIGURED (05-01, MIG-05). The two telemetry lines --
 * imply_option("MOZ_SERVICES_HEALTHREPORT", False) and
 * imply_option("MOZ_NORMANDY", False) -- are FIXED platform content, not
 * manifest keys. The manifest covers identity, branding, telemetry,
 * extensions, URLs and pins; these two build flags are platform policy
 * (this tree compiles both subsystems out for every downstream), not
 * downstream-varying brand, so no manifest key feeds them and no rebrand
 * can switch them. A downstream that needs either subsystem carries its
 * own patch. This is also why the brand-value scan
 * (scripts/check-patch-surface.sh) never matches them: that scan derives
 * its set from configuration.toml, and these lines derive from nothing but
 * this emitter.
 *
 * MOZ_APP_ID is deliberately NOT carried here. The 05-01 audit proved the
 * GUID line is byte-identical stock context -- `git show
 * HEAD:browser/moz.configure` already carries
 * "{ec8030f7-c20a-464f-9b0e-13a3a9e97384}" and patch 010 never changed it
 * (it rides the hunk as a context line, not a +line). Relocating it would
 * delete a stock line only to re-add the identical value elsewhere: churn
 * with a second source for one fact. It stays where upstream put it. (This
 * corrects the 03-04 comment that called it "patch-carried".)
 *
 * WHY ONE FILE, NOT ONE PER VARIANT. Vendor and UA name do not vary by
 * variant -- the dev/release split is name_suffix, which reaches the build
 * as MOZ_APP_DISPLAYNAME through configure.sh. One fragment on the dev
 * variant row, like the single .mozconfig.
 *
 * UA_NAME takes no manifest key by design -- it is the D-78 compat literal
 * (same rationale as -brand-product-name = Firefox in emitBrandFtl).
 * The vendor line passes the sink guard; the UA literal and the two fixed
 * policy lines carry no interpolation: the fragment executes in the
 * configure sandbox, so a quote in either vendor value would break out of
 * its string.
 *
 * The fragment reaches the build through the topsrcdir-internal symlink
 * upstream/identity.configure (setup-created by fetch-upstream.sh
 * alongside the branding overlay, never committed), which the patch
 * includes as ../identity.configure -- lexically inside topsrcdir for the
 * sandbox's basedir check, resolving to this file outside it.
 *
 * CARRIER BANNER (05-01, WR-05). The shared GENERATED_BANNER's recovery
 * pointers are wrong for this file -- there is no tracked
 * identity.configure to copy over, and until the MIG-05 comparand the
 * generated-byte-identity row skipped untracked rows -- so the carrier
 * carries its own banner naming the real pointers: this emitter, the
 * upstream symlink, and the two gates that redden on a disagreement.
 *
 * Joined with a literal newline, never the platform line-ending constant.

 * The Theia application frontend-config fragment (04-01, GEN-05 tracer):

 * `theia.frontend.config` block -- `applicationName` from
 * identity.display_name, and (04-04) `defaultTheme` from
 * theia.default_theme.
 *
 * WHICH DISPLAY FORM. identity.display_name is the BASE name -- the release
 * short name the preflight pins on the tracked package.json against the
 * inventory, never the manifest. The dev name_suffix never reaches the
 * Theia window title: there is one application manifest, not one per
 * variant, so a suffixed name would brand every window Dev.
 *
 * THEME SHAPE. Theia's DefaultTheme is a string id or a {light, dark} pair
 * (application-package application-props.ts); the manifest carries the
 * string form only, and the emitter passes it through verbatim. An unset
 * theme omits the key rather than restating Theia's own default pair --
 * restating it would make this file a second source for Theia's default.
 * validateTheia has already refused unknown ids, and the sink guard below
 * re-checks the enum so a future loosening cannot emit an arbitrary
 * string into the fragment.
 *
 * FRAGMENT, NOT THE WHOLE BLOCK. The tracked package.json carries sibling
 * keys no rebrand owns -- powerbrowserPrivilegedJs, the preferences map --
 * so emitting the whole object would make this file's literals the owner
 * of Theia behaviour flags. The copy-over is surgical instead: set ONLY
 * the keys of this fragment and leave every sibling
 * byte-identical. Whole-file byte-identity is brittle here anyway -- yarn
 * rewrites that file -- which is why the contract is block-level equality
 * on these keys rather than a tracked comparand row.
 *
 * WHY NO GENERATED_BANNER. Strict JSON carries no comment, and a `_comment`
 * key would pollute the block a reader copies from. The derivation is
 * stated here instead; freshness is generate --check's contract through
 * the frozen TARGETS row below, and the tracked side is
 * verify-branding-preflight.mjs's applicationName assertion.
 *
 * The value passes the shell sink guard. A JSON string value must refuse a
 * double quote and a backslash or one value rewrites the document around
 * it; the dollar/backtick/tab/newline rejections cost nothing here and keep
 * every interpolation in this file under one rule, exactly as emitBrandFtl
 * already does for Fluent terms. The schema patterns already exclude all
 * of these, so on a validated manifest this guard never fires -- it is

 * FrontendApplicationConfigProvider with the compiled values as boot
 * fallbacks, so a rebrand is a manifest edit plus the app-bundle step,
 * never a `.ts` edit.
 *
 * FRAGMENT, NOT THE WHOLE BLOCK (04-01's rule carried over, 04-03's
 * precedent: one fragment per brand-owned key, same package.json block).
 * No tracked comparand -- the tracked package.json is yarn-managed, so
 * whole-file byte-identity is brittle there; the copy-over sets ONLY the
 * powerbrowserBranding key from this fragment, and the byte-identity gate
 * skips rows without one while --check still covers the row through the
 * frozen table. The tracked side is pinned by
 * scripts/verify-theia-branding.mjs (fragment equality against this
 * emission, block equality on the tracked key).
 *
 * WHY NO GENERATED_BANNER. Same reason as the fragments before it:
 * strict JSON carries no comment, and a `_comment` key would pollute the
 * block a reader copies from. Derivation lives here; freshness is
 * generate --check's contract.
 *
 * UNSET TEXTS ARE NULL. welcome_text and about_text are required: false
 * with no shipped value -- an unset text emits null and the widgets render
 * no element for it, rather than inventing copy the manifest never stated.
 * An explicitly emptied string never reaches here: the schema pattern
 * needs one or more characters, so it fails validation naming the key.
 *
 * THE REPO URL IS REUSED, NOT RESTATED. There is no `urls.repo_url` key:
 * installer.support_url is already the one support URL (falling back to
 * product.homepage where a downstream states no installer section), so a
 * second key for the same value would be one setting with two paths. The
 * value is emitted verbatim -- no trailing-slash normalisation (CFG-03:
 * rejection only, never mangling).
 *
 * THE MARK IS TEXT, NOT BINARY. The 04-01 channel decision left the logo
 * BINARY channel open because a PNG cannot ride a JSON string; the mark
  * SVG is text, so it rides as a string key, read from brand/mark.svg at
  * emit time. No assertEmittable on it: the SVG legitimately carries double
  * quotes, and JSON.stringify is the correct escaping for a JSON sink --
  * the shell-sink guard would reject every real logo. Its presence is
  * asserted above; its shape is the icon pipeline's contract.
  *
  * LEGAL NOTICES (06-04) ride as a string array, one notice per line (see
  * emitLegalNotices for the per-notice derivation): the downstream's own
  * trademark notice, the Mozilla non-association sentence, and the Eclipse
  * attribution sentence. The About dialog renders them as text nodes
  * through the channel reader with compiled fallbacks where the provider

// types are frozen below (T-03-04, the same structural reason as the raster
// step), and Buffer.concat carries the payloads through untouched.

// what these writers guarantee is structural validity -- magic, counts,

/**
 * Every output path lives here and nowhere else, and the default run, --check
 * and plan 02-05's byte-identity gate all iterate this one array.
 *
 * BOTH PATHS IN EVERY ENTRY ARE STRING LITERALS. No value out of
 * configuration.toml is ever joined into a write path -- a variant carries
 * branding_dir and objdir as emitted CONTENT, never as a write target. That is
 * structurally what stops a config key directing a write outside generated/
 * (T-02-02, GEN-04), and it is why the variant schema carries no
 * output-filename key at all: there is nowhere for one to be honoured.
 *
 * THAT PROPERTY IS ABOUT WRITE PATHS AND NOTHING ELSE. It says where the bytes
 * land, not what they say, and reading it as the whole threat model is a
 * mistake this comment used to invite: manifest values ARE joined into the
 * emitted CONTENT, and that content is a shell script the Gecko build sources
 * and a launcher the desktop runs. Those sinks have their own guard --
 * a schema pattern per key, backed by assertEmittable at each interpolation.
 *
 * The two generated .desktop filenames are FIXED platform identifiers in Phase
 * 2. Naming a downstream's installed desktop entry after its own binary is
 * GEN-03 and belongs to Phase 3's packaging surfaces; doing it here would mean
 * a manifest value chose a filename, which is exactly the property above.

 * hunting a mismatch that does not exist.
 *
 * The set comparison runs in BOTH directions. A per-target loop alone sees a
 * file that is missing or wrong but is blind to one that should no longer be
 * there at all, so an emitter deleted later would leave its output behind
 * forever with nothing to notice.
 *
 * Returns an exit code rather than exiting, so the temporary directory's
 * cleanup is not skipped on the way out.
 *
 * `root` is a PARAMETER for the same reason writeTargets' is, and for one more:
 * --self-test drives THIS function, not a re-implementation of it, by pointing
 * it at a throwaway tree it is free to corrupt. The tracked files and the
 * real generated/ are never touched by a planted fault (02-05's rule). The
 * reported paths keep the `generated/` prefix whatever the root is, because
 * that prefix names the output surface a reader has to go and fix, not the
