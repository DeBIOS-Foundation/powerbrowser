// shell-error-contract -- 01-11, extended by 01-12 and 01-13.
//
// The error state's behavioural contract, driven against the shipped supervisor
// and the shipped chrome bootstrap. Four scenarios, all four closing a clause
// 01-VERIFICATION.md recorded FAILED.
//
// (1) The REPAINT contract: a Retry that fails must put the error
// layer back. 01-VERIFICATION.md recorded that clause FAILED (truth 2c). The
// root cause was two owners for one fact -- the chrome bootstrap's Retry global
// blanked the error element itself while the supervisor's `_errorShown` repaint
// guard stayed set, so the FIRST failing Retry left the DOM blank and the guard
// swallowed every later repaint for the life of the session: no message, no
// Retry, no Details, forever.
//
// This shipped green through three full verification runs because no registered
// check ever observes a SECOND error sentinel. verify-platform.sh's
// shell03-budget-exhausted-error asserts there is exactly ONE, which is correct
// for the launch it drives and blind to this one.
//
// HOW THIS ASSERTS. It does not re-implement the supervisor and it does not
// text-transform either source. It EVALUATES both shipped files in-process:
//
//   * the supervisor is `await import()`ed with `globalThis.ChromeUtils` faked,
//     so its own top-level `ChromeUtils.importESModule` resolves against a fake
//     PowerBrowserAPI with no edit to the file. A distinct cache-busting query
//     per scenario gives each scenario a fresh module instance with fresh
//     per-launch fields.
//   * the chrome bootstrap is run through `node:vm` against a sandbox that is
//     also its own `window`, so its `window.powerbrowser*` assignments land
//     where the supervisor can reach them. Firing the captured
//     `DOMContentLoaded` handler IS the drive -- the handler calls
//     `TheiaService.start()` itself, so the entry point stays under test rather
//     than under simulation.
//
// The fake PowerBrowserAPI is a Proxy whose unknown-property trap THROWS naming
// the method, so a supervisor change that reaches a new boundary method goes red
// naming it instead of being silently satisfied.
//
// Before any scenario runs, the analyzer proves the two sentinel prefixes it
// reads are emitted by `dump(` call sites in the file under test, so a match
// could never come from the harness's own instrumentation. The only
// instrumentation here is a recording `dump`, and every line it records was
// written by the code under test.
//
// Scenario `two-consecutive-failing-retries-repaint`: drive a launch on the
// RECOVERABLE class -- the class that OFFERS Retry -- then click Retry twice.
// 01-13 retargeted it there from the spawn-throw drive, which `_spawnAndGate`
// classifies unrecoverable at its D-113 site: under 01-13's supervisor guard a
// Retry against that class is a no-op by design, so the old drive would have
// gone red for the wrong reason. The repaint contract is a statement about the
// class the interface is willing to retry, so that is where it belongs, and the
// unrecoverable class is covered by scenario (4) below instead. A recorded
// classification guard stops the drive drifting silently back.
// The error-family sentinel stream must read, IN ORDER:
//   POWERBROWSER_SHELL_ERROR, POWERBROWSER_SHELL_ERROR_CLEARED,
//   POWERBROWSER_SHELL_ERROR, POWERBROWSER_SHELL_ERROR_CLEARED,
//   POWERBROWSER_SHELL_ERROR
// -- five presence assertions, never an absence assertion. A shape assertion
// rides along: every recorded error sentinel's JSON must carry exactly the keys
// `reason` and `recoverable`, the same anchored contract
// shell03-budget-exhausted-error enforces on the first sentinel, so a repaint
// that starts leaking a key (the per-launch token above all) goes red here too.
//
// (2)+(3) THE PROBE GATE, 01-12 (failed truth 2d). `_showError` received a
// `recoverable` classification and started D-115's background recovery probe
// regardless, so the one class the supervisor's own D-113 comment calls
// "unrecoverable by construction ... with no retry at all" drove a process spawn
// every probe interval, for the life of the session, against a `_configDir` and
// a `_stateFilePath` that branch returns before ever assigning.
//
// The gate is asserted in BOTH directions, because only one direction is a
// convenient half-truth: `unrecoverable-classification-starts-no-probe` requires
// ZERO probe-driven spawns after an error state whose `recoverable` was false,
// and `recoverable-classification-starts-the-probe` -- the positive control --
// requires AT LEAST ONE after an error state whose `recoverable` was true. A fix
// that simply stopped probing everywhere passes the first and fails the second,
// which is what stops the gate being satisfied by never probing at all.
//
// The instrument is a counter on the fake boundary's own spawn stub, so it
// counts calls THE SUPERVISOR MADE, never a line this harness printed. It is
// causal rather than temporal -- "spawns that happened after the error sentinel
// was recorded" -- because with the fake sleep resolving immediately the probe
// is a pure microtask loop that burns its entire sleep budget inside one
// microtask drain, long before any `setImmediate` turn the harness could read a
// counter on. That is also why the two scenarios share ONE drain constant: the
// negative side's zero is only meaningful because the positive side proves the
// same drain is long enough for the probe to have run.
//
// (4) THE USER-DRIVEN ROUTE, 01-13 (the same failed truth 2d, re-scoped by
// 01-REVIEW.md's CR-01). The classification gated the probe TIMER and nothing
// else: `retry()` re-entered `_restart()` unconditionally, so the unrecoverable
// class was re-entered by the single control the error screen offered, and every
// such click ran `_hideError()` on the way past, nulling `_failureDetails` --
// erasing the only evidence the user had left. Scenario
// `unrecoverable-classification-refuses-the-retry-click` drives that exact
// click, calling the window global DIRECTLY rather than through the button, so a
// fix that only hid the control cannot satisfy it. It asserts zero spawns,
// unchanged diagnostic rows, and the control absent -- three separate facts, one
// planted fault each in --self-test.
//
// This is what verify-platform.sh's `check_shell03_unrecoverable_immediate_error`
// could not see. It asserts an unrecoverable classification reaches no spawn
// ATTEMPT within its 15-second window, and it is green because the probe's first
// interval had not elapsed yet -- correct for the window it drives, blind to the
// second one.
//
// WHAT THIS DOES NOT PROVE. It proves the supervisor/bootstrap contract and the
// sentinel ordering under Node. It does not prove the pixels. The perceptual
// half -- a human clicking Retry in a real window and seeing the error layer
// come back -- stays on the WINDOWS.md human record, because chrome-context
// Marionette is platform-blocked on Linux (ledger item 7).
//
// Usage:
//   node scripts/verify-shell-error-contract.mjs [--file <path>] [--shell-file <path>]
//   node scripts/verify-shell-error-contract.mjs --self-test
//
// Exit 0 pass, 1 fail. --self-test runs a clean control against the unmutated
// tree FIRST (a self-test whose fixture is already red proves nothing about its
// plants), then plants nine faults and requires each to go red naming the
// drift.
