/**
 * GEN-04's byte-identity gate: what the generator emits from
 * configuration.toml is byte-for-byte the five build surfaces Phase 1 wrote by
 * hand.
 *
 * This is the phase's acceptance test made mechanical. Phase 1 deliberately
 * wrote every branding value as a hand-written literal -- CLAUDE.md says so in
 * as many words -- precisely so that Phase 2 would have something INDEPENDENT
 * to compare its generator against. Those five tracked files are that
 * comparand. They are never edited to make this check green; when this check
 * goes red, the emitter is what changed.
 *
 * ## Why the ACTUAL emitter set is derived and only the EXPECTED set is written down
 *
 * The tempting shape is a hand-kept list of five paths that the check loops
 * over. That check agrees with every tree: it can never go red on a SIXTH
 * emitter being added, because it never asks the generator what it emits. So
 * the actual set is DERIVED from generate.mjs's own frozen target table at
 * check time and compared to the declared set as a SET EQUALITY, which
 * discriminates in both directions -- a surplus emitter is reported by path, a
 * declared file whose emitter was deleted is reported by path. `--self-test`
 * proves that against a planted surplus and a planted removal rather than
 * trusting it.
 *
 * ## Why this emits into its own temporary directory instead of reading generated/
 *
 * This is the part that will not be obvious to a future reader. `generated/` is
 * git-ignored (.gitignore line `/generated/`), so every fresh clone and every
 * CI runner starts WITHOUT it. A check that compared the tracked files against
 * `generated/` would therefore be red on a tree with no defect at all -- and a
 * gate that is red for a reason that is not a defect trains its readers to
 * ignore it, at which point it gates nothing. So this check emits its own
 * comparand into an `mkdtempSync` directory removed in a `finally`, reads
 * nothing under `generated/`, and writes nothing there either. Running it on a
 * tree that has never run the generator is a supported case, not an edge case.
 *
 * The freshness of `generated/` itself is a DIFFERENT question with a different
 * answer, and it has its own instrument: `node scripts/generate.mjs --check`.
 *
 * Honestly --quick: it reads the manifest and five tracked text files and
 * writes into the OS temp directory. No build, no browser, no display, no
 * network.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/verify-generated-identity.mjs
 *   node scripts/verify-generated-identity.mjs --self-test
