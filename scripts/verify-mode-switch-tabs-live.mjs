/**
 * GUI-07's mode-switch tabs invariant, PROVEN BY OBSERVATION (14-04).
 *
 * 14-UI-SPEC.md:223 and :232-233 contract that content tabs never unmount,
 * close, move windows, or detach on a mode switch. Every gate that existed
 * before this one reads TEXT: verify-mode-switch-tabs-invariant.mjs derives the
 * shell-mutating calls inside five anchored function bodies in two of our own
 * files, and verify-mode-toggle-commands.mjs derives ids and labels. Neither
 * can see inside `@theia/core`, and the whole defect lives there -- stock's
 * `doSwitchPerspective` restores the target perspective's SAVED layout over the
 * live one, and Lumino's `restoreLayout` unparents every widget absent from
 * that snapshot (@lumino/widgets/dist/index.js:9564-9571). A product that
 * destroyed a tab on every mode switch shipped with both text gates green.
 * This file is the behavioural half they structurally cannot be: it drives a
 * real frontend and looks at real widgets.
 *
 * THE SECOND VISIT IS THE WHOLE POINT. The teardown is CONDITIONAL --
 * perspective-service.js:131 `const savedLayout = this.savedLayouts.get(id)`,
 * and the destructive branch at :135 runs only when that snapshot exists. A
 * mode's FIRST activation takes the `applyViewPlacements` branch instead, which
 * is additive and destroys nothing. So a protocol that visits each mode once is
 * GREEN ON A BROKEN TREE, and it is the likeliest reason an earlier live run
 * honestly reported this invariant holding. Every hop this file measures is a
 * hop into a perspective that already carries a snapshot, and the seed is
 * opened AFTER those snapshots are taken -- which is the user's own sequence:
 * switch modes, open a tab, switch back.
 *
 * WHAT IT ASSERTS, per measured hop:
 *   - the main-area widget-id set, as SET EQUALITY IN BOTH DIRECTIONS. A loss
 *     is a destroyed tab; a surplus is an unreviewed tab the switch conjured.
 *   - the bottom-area widget-id set, the same way. The bottom area is the other
 *     half of what the exemption strips out of the saved layouts, so leaving it
 *     unasserted would let the fix regress on its second panel.
 *   - `isAttached` on every recorded widget OBJECT, SEPARATELY from the id
 *     sets. Lumino sets `parent = null` (:9569) and disposes the old tab bars
 *     (:9572) as independent statements, so a widget can vanish from
 *     `mainAreaTabBars` while still reporting attached, and vice versa. Held on
 *     the object, never re-looked-up by id: `shell.getWidgetById` resolves
 *     against the shell's FocusTracker (application-shell.js:1923-1929), which
 *     RETAINS a detached widget, so an id lookup would answer about whatever
 *     instance exists now rather than about the tab that was open.
 *
 * WHAT IT DERIVES FROM THE TREE, never hand-keeps:
 *   - the shipped mode ids, from mode-descriptors.ts, compared SET-EQUAL
 *     against the live `getRegisteredPerspectives()`, plus stock's own
 *     `DEFAULT_PERSPECTIVE_ID` literal and the custom ids the live ModeService
 *     reports. Red on a mode in the tree that never registered AND on a
 *     perspective in the app that no source accounts for.
 *   - the registration sinks. There are TWO spellings and the second is the one
 *     that gets missed: `registerPerspective(` (modes-frontend-module.ts:41,
 *     mode-service.ts:413) and the `registerPerspectives` OVERRIDE at
 *     branding/src/browser/powerbrowser-ai-layout-contribution.ts:23, which is
 *     a no-op today and would be a whole extra mode tomorrow. Both are
 *     enumerated from the sources, and any literal id a sink registers must be
 *     one the live app registered -- a mode that reached the registry without
 *     reaching the exemption is exactly the hole this covers.
 *   - the seed widget and its area, from powerbrowser-welcome-contribution.ts.
 *     If that contribution ever stops declaring area 'main' the seed stops
 *     being a main-area tab, and the check fails as a broken instrument rather
 *     than passing with nothing to lose. `explorer-view-container` is
 *     deliberately never seeded: it is a SIDE-panel view that the Coding
 *     descriptor's own `viewPlacements` moves, so a check seeded with it would
 *     be asserting against a widget the contract says a mode may relocate.
 *   - the organising placeholder's widget id, from organising-widget.ts. The
 *     Organising slot opens and closes exactly one main-area widget as a
 *     CONTRACTED part of that mode (mode-service.ts activateMode), so it is
 *     excluded from both id sets -- the same exclusion chrome-bar's countTabs
 *     makes, for the same reason, and read from the same single definition.
 *
 * NON-VACUITY. A derivation that yields nothing fails as a broken instrument:
 * zero shipped ids, zero registration sinks, an unreadable seed, and -- the one
 * that matters most -- a seed that produced ZERO main-area widgets. A check
 * with nothing to lose cannot detect loss, and would report the strongest
 * possible green for the weakest possible reason.
 *
 * THE CHROME BAR'S OWN TAB-COUNT `console.error` IS CORROBORATION ONLY. It is
 * collected and printed beside the verdict and is never read as an assertion:
 * CLAUDE.md's first verification rule is that a check may not assert on a log
 * line it also arranges to see, and countTabs is instrumentation the switch
 * path emits about itself. Expect it to be SILENT on a normal run and do not
 * read that as breakage: the walk drives the mode command directly, and the
 * before/after comparison lives in the widget's own click handler
 * (chrome-bar-widget.tsx selectMode), which a command-driven switch never
 * enters. The channel is here so a line that does appear is visible, not
 * because its absence means anything.
 *
 * HONESTLY TIERED -- THIS CANNOT BE `--quick`. It launches the built
 * `objdir/dist/bin/powerbrowser` headless and drives the shell's own supervised
 * Theia frontend over WebDriver BiDi, exactly as verify-gui01-command.mjs does.
 * Everything it asserts about is a live widget in a live shell -- there is no
 * `document`, no shell and no widget to observe in a bare Node tier, and on a
 * tree with no `objdir/` it fails at the binary's existence check rather than
 * degrading into a text scan. Register it in the full set, never the commit
 * gate. One clean run is roughly 30 seconds; `--self-test` boots five sessions
 * and takes a little over two minutes.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT PROVE. It observes one profile, one boot and one walk. It
 * says nothing about a layout restored from a PREVIOUS session (the browser
 * profile is a fresh mkdtemp every run, so ShellLayoutRestorer has nothing to
 * hydrate), nothing about custom modes unless the live app happens to carry
 * some, and nothing about what a human sees -- a widget can be attached and
 * still be painted wrong.
