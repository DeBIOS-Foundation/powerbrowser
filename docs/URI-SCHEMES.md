# Tab addresses (URI schemes)

Every shipped tab in Sourcerer has a typeable address of the form
`scheme:path` — no host, no query, no fragment, no encoded payload. This
document names every scheme the app registers, what the path encodes, what
an empty path means, and its open-versus-focus behaviour. It also states
the four cases that genuinely degrade, and why — those are documented
trade-offs, not defects to file.

The vocabulary used below (`open` / `reveal` / `activate`) is Theia's own
(`WidgetOpenMode` in `@theia/core`), not a parallel one this phase invents.
`open` attaches a widget to the shell for the first time; `reveal` scrolls
it into view without stealing focus; `activate` (the default for every
handler in this document) both reveals and focuses it.

## General rules

- **Canonical printed form is the opaque `scheme:path`** — never
  `scheme://authority`. A URI's authority component is lower-cased on
  serialization, and Theia's own widget ids are not uniformly lowercase, so
  the authority form would silently fork two spellings of one address into
  two widgets. (The two existing schemes that predate this phase —
  `preference:` and `vscode-extension:` — keep whatever form Theia's own
  code already emits; this rule governs the five schemes this phase adds
  or extends.)
- **Parsing is lenient, emission is canonical.** `scheme:x`, `scheme:/x`,
  `scheme:///x` and `scheme://x` all parse to the identical name. Exactly
  one form ever comes back out of the reverse lookup. This is why an
  address copied out of the app and typed back in by hand behaves
  identically regardless of which of the four spellings was typed.
- **The path is identity and identity only** — no query, no fragment, no
  JSON, no base64, no uuid. A URI's `toString()` percent-encodes the query
  component, so anything a human is expected to copy-paste exactly must
  come from `toString(true)`; the simplest way to guarantee that survives
  copy-paste is to have nothing in the address that ever needed encoding
  in the first place.
- **Non-user-chosen discriminators never appear in an address.** A
  randomly generated counter, a wall-clock creation token, a backend
  process id — anything the user did not choose and could not retype from
  memory — stays in the widget's construction options, never in the URI.

## `view:`

Addresses every singleton or stable-id docked or panel view — side-panel
views, bottom-panel views, and the handful of main-area singletons that
behave like a view rather than a document (the welcome tab, the bulk-edit
preview). The path is the widget or view-container id exactly as Theia
spells it internally — the same string the persisted layout's own
`constructionOptions.factoryId` already carries, so there is nothing to
translate between "the id" and "the address."

An empty path is not valid for this scheme; every `view:` address names one
specific target. Opening an unknown `view:` path raises a visible error
rather than silently resolving to nothing — a silent no-op is exactly wrong
at the moment a human has just typed the address by hand.

Open/focus: delegates to the target's own `AbstractViewContribution.openView()`,
so a `view:` open lands in the same panel, with the same reveal/activate
behaviour, as using the view's own menu entry or command — there is no
separate, possibly-different placement logic for the URI path.

### Coverage boundary

Included, and addressed **as containers, not as parts**: the Explorer is
`view:explorer-view-container`, not `view:files`. A view container's
composition mutates at runtime — dragging Debug's Variables part into the
Explorer's own container is ordinary Theia behaviour — so a container
address names a box, never a fixed set of contents. The same holds for
Search, SCM, and Test's own containers.

Excluded from this phase, and addressable later at zero design cost:
sub-views inside a container (`files`, `theia-open-editors-widget`, each of
Debug's five parts, each of SCM's three, each of Test's two, everything
under Timeline). Theia's own side-panel machinery only ever searches
top-level dock-panel widgets when expanding a view, so a part is a
collapsible section inside its container's tab, not a tab of its own — "no
tab without a URI" simply does not reach something that was never a tab.
`shell.activateWidget(id)` already walks down through a container to reveal
one of its parts, so adding per-part addresses later needs no new
machinery, only a table entry.

### The full `view:` address list

| Path | Container? |
|---|---|
| `problems` | no |
| `explorer-view-container` | yes |
| `outline-view` | no |
| `search-view-container` | yes |
| `scm-view-container` | yes |
| `debug` | no |
| `debug-console` | no |
| `disassembly-view-widget` | no |
| `test-view-container` | yes |
| `test-result-widget` | no |
| `test-output-view` | no |
| `callhierarchy` | no |
| `theia-typehierarchy` | no |
| `keybindings.view.widget` | no |
| `chat-view-widget` | no |
| `ai-configuration` | no |
| `ai-sessions-widget` | no |
| `bulkedit` | no |
| `plugins` | no |
| `vsx-extensions-view-container` | yes |
| `welcome` | no |

Plugin-contributed view containers (from an installed VS Code extension)
need no table entry: their widget id is already assigned as
`plugin-view-container:<viewContainerId>` at creation time, so the widget's
own `.id` **is** the full `view:` path — e.g.
`view:plugin-view-container:my-extension-container`.

### The `keybindings.view.widget` dots note

That path contains dots, which looks like it should be forbidden — this
phase's own path rule bans a dot in a *Navigatable* URI's final segment,
because `initResourceContextKeys` derives a file extension
(`resourceExtname`) from a Navigatable's path, and `settings:editor.fontSize`-shaped
input would otherwise yield a bogus `.fontSize` extension. `view:` addresses
are never Navigatable (see the "Terminal is the exception" note under
`terminal:` below), so that hazard cannot fire here. Theia's own widget id
cannot be changed without an upstream patch this project does not make, so
the id is kept verbatim, with this note attached rather than a workaround.

## `settings:`

Addresses the Settings widget. An empty path opens or focuses the widget
itself. A non-empty path is a preference id (e.g.
`settings:editor.fontSize`) and is delegated verbatim to Theia's own
already-bound preference open handler — this phase never reimplements
preference navigation, only routes to it.

Settings is its own scheme rather than a `view:` row because its widget
extends Lumino's raw `Panel`, not Theia's `BaseWidget` — the tab bar's own
navigable check requires `BaseWidget`, so Settings could never satisfy it
by any amount of method-stamping. That is also why this phase's widget→URI
direction is a registry lookup rather than a `Navigatable` implementation
on every addressable widget: Settings is proof that the two approaches are
not interchangeable, and the registry is the one that reaches both kinds.

Open/focus: same `openView()` delegation as `view:`.

## `terminal:`

The one genuinely multi-instance scheme in this set. The path is a short,
lowercase, user-facing name — `t1`, `t2`, … by default, or a name the
caller supplied — and that name **is** the terminal's instance identity,
not a label. Renaming a terminal's tab title changes only what is
displayed; the address a human typed to reach that terminal keeps working
unchanged, because re-keying the address on a rename would mean disposing
and recreating the shell underneath the user.

A terminal created with no caller-supplied identity is named `t1` on an
empty session, then `t2`, then `t3` — the lowest name not already in use,
so a session that has restored `t1` and `t3` from a previous layout
allocates `t2` next, never repeating a name still in use. Both the minted
name and the identity fields it is stored under land in the terminal's
persisted construction options, and replay verbatim when Theia restores a
layout — this is what makes a terminal's address survive a page reload:
open `terminal:t1`, reload, `terminal:t1` still resolves to the same shell.

An empty path means the active terminal, or a new one if none exists.
`terminal:t1` on a session where `t1` already exists focuses it and
creates nothing. `terminal:build` on a session where no terminal is named
`build` creates a fresh shell under that name, rather than erroring — the
tmux named-target model, and the reason an address like `terminal:build`
is worth typing at all instead of always meaning "the last terminal I had
open."

Terminal is the **only** widget type in this phase that implements a real
`Navigatable` — its widget genuinely extends `BaseWidget` (the tab bar's
navigable check requires that, and every other candidate, like Settings,
does not qualify), and tab-context URI selection is a real win for a type
where more than one instance is the normal case. Its resource URI equals
its `terminal:` address exactly. This does **not** enable Save-As on a
terminal: the Save-As gate first requires the widget to be a
`SaveableSource` (something with a `.saveable` property), and Terminal has
none — it fails that test before the Navigatable check the URI address
depends on is ever consulted.

## `output:`

Already registered by `@theia/output`; this phase adds only the missing
widget→address direction and fixes the direction that already shipped. The
path is a channel name (e.g. `output:Tasks`), and the address always
carries the widget's **active** channel — never a bare `output:` with the
channel silently dropped. Opening `output:<channel>` selects that channel
in the Output panel and reveals it.

The Output widget is a **singleton** whose visible content swaps per
channel — see the carve-out below for what this means for round-tripping.

## `preference:`

Already registered by `@theia/preferences` at a fixed priority, unchanged
by this phase. The path is a preference id (e.g.
`preference:editor.fontSize`); opening one reveals that setting inside the
Settings widget. No competing handler is registered for this scheme —
confirmed live, none of this phase's own open handlers claim it.

## `vscode-extension:`

Already registered by `@theia/vsx-registry`. Addresses the detail editor
for one installed (or installable) extension, keyed by its extension id
and an optional version — e.g. `vscode-extension://my-publisher.my-ext/1.2.3`.
This scheme keeps the authority form Theia's own code already emits; the
opaque-form rule above governs the schemes this phase introduces or
extends, not a scheme this phase only reads from.

## `webview:` (session-scoped)

New in this phase, and explicitly **not** restore-safe across a restart —
see the carve-out below. The path is `<viewType>/<panelId>`, both minted by
the plugin host at the moment an installed extension calls
`createWebviewPanel`. Within the session that created it, opening the
address reopens the exact same panel — Theia's own widget cache resolves
it as a hit, with all its real content still attached. There is nothing to
type from memory here (a panel id is not human-mnemonic), but the address
still round-trips: copy it out of the registry, and pasting it back into
the same session's opener reopens the same tab.

A degenerate `webview:<id>` address (no `/<viewType>` segment) is resolved
against already-open panels by `id` alone rather than treated as a request
to create one — opening it raises a visible error if no open panel matches,
the same "an unknown or under-specified address must surface an error, not
silently mint something new" discipline `view:` applies. The two-segment
form is the only one this phase's own registry ever emits, so this case is
reached only if an address is typed or constructed by hand.

## The four carve-outs

These are the cases D-51 identified as unavoidable inside this phase's
scope, and each is asserted as documented behaviour rather than treated as
a failure by `scripts/verify-uri-roundtrip.mjs`. The wording below matches
`existing-scheme-coverage.ts`'s own `CARVE_OUTS` list verbatim, so this
document and the code never drift apart on what each one says.

1. **`output`** — `@theia/output`'s widget is a singleton whose content
   swaps per channel — `output:A` and `output:B` resolve to the same tab
   (factory id `outputView`).
2. **`editor-preview`** — `@theia/editor-preview` swaps the document a tab
   shows without user navigation, so a tab's resource URI mutates in place
   — not mechanically probable without a live preview-triggering
   navigation.
3. **`vscode-notebook-cell`** — notebook's `vscode-notebook-cell:` handler
   is a registered scheme that opens no tab and returns `undefined`.
4. **`webview`** — `webview:` addresses only round-trip within a session —
   panel ids are minted per `createWebviewPanel` call by the plugin host,
   so without a live plugin-contributed panel this cannot be probed
   mechanically.

## What this is for

`TabUriRegistry`'s exported shape (`getViewContribution`, `parseName`,
`createWidgetOptions`, `uriOf`) is the interface the post-4.0 unified
browser bridge consumes to model a Theia tab as a chrome-owned tab —
deliberately small and stable, not a place to grow speculative surface.
Nothing in v4.0 itself renders these addresses anywhere in Theia's own tab
bar; that presentation work is bridge scope, not this phase's.
