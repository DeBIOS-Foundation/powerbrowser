# Building PowerBrowser

This documents the commands that actually built and ran both halves of
PowerBrowser on the reference NixOS host, with the durations actually measured
there. It does not describe the patch-stack tree, artifact builds, or a
rebase procedure — those land in Phase 3.

**What every timing in this document is attributed to.** The reference host is
`legion` — 16 cores, 62 GB RAM, NixOS. Each figure below additionally names the
**tree** it was measured on (rows predating the rename say so explicitly) and
the **date**, and every one of them was produced under the pinned Gecko
toolchain recorded in `toolchain-baseline.txt` at that commit — the same file
`scripts/toolchain-baseline.sh` regenerates and the Phase 3 rebase procedure
diffs against. A figure is only comparable to a new measurement taken under the
same three: tree, host, toolchain. **These numbers are carried forward rather
than re-measured**: re-running the tier-3 rows alone costs about eighty minutes
and would reproduce them, and D-73 forbids presenting an inherited number as a
fresh measurement, so each row cites the summary it was measured in.

## Prerequisites

- NixOS (or any host with Nix flakes enabled — `experimental-features =
  nix-command flakes`).
- ~30 GB free disk and 8 GB RAM for the Firefox half (a full non-artifact
  compile peaks around 14 G of `objdir/`, on top of the ~5.6 G `upstream/`
  checkout).
- **The repository must live at a path with no space character.**
  `pkgs.mkShell` appends an rpath to the space-separated `NIX_LDFLAGS`
  environment variable; a space in the checkout path makes the cc-wrapper
  split that variable on the space and every native link step fails. Both
  the Firefox compile and Theia's `node-gyp` native modules drive that same
  linker, so this is not a Firefox-only caveat — clone somewhere like
  `~/coding/Power-Browser` (this repo's own path on the reference host),
  never under a directory such as `~/My Projects`.

Nothing else needs installing by hand. Both `nix develop` shells below
supply their entire toolchain; there is no `mach bootstrap` step and no
separate Node/Yarn/Rust install (D-18).

## Theia half

The app composes the frozen 49-`@theia/*`-package daily-drivable set
(Phase 2 D-19) — 11 packages proved the build in Phase 1; every package
that was ever going to ship is now in the tree.

```
nix develop .#theia
cd theia
yarn install --ignore-scripts --frozen-lockfile
(cd node_modules/drivelist && node-gyp rebuild)
yarn build
yarn start
```

Then open **http://localhost:3000** (`127.0.0.1:3000`) — that is the port
`theia start` actually binds; do not assume it moved. `yarn start`
(`applications/browser`'s own script) also sets two environment variables
explicitly before invoking `theia start` — see "Environment variables the
start script sets", below.

Why `--ignore-scripts` plus one explicit rebuild, not a plain `yarn
install`: this was a deliberate decision, re-audited at 49 packages after
first being decided at 11 (Phase 1). **Re-run at 49 packages (Phase 2
Plan 04):** the transitive tree is now 1,058 packages deep (depth ≤ 3,
`@theia/plugin-ext` alone adds roughly 38 direct dependencies), of which
**7** carry an `install`/`preinstall`/`postinstall` script — `@parcel/
watcher`, `drivelist`, `esbuild`, `keytar`, `msgpackr-extract`, `node-pty`,
`puppeteer`. **`drivelist` remains the only load-bearing one** — version
12.0.2 ships no prebuilt binary, and `@theia/core` requires its compiled
`.node` at backend boot, unconditionally, on every target. The other six
are not load-bearing under `--ignore-scripts`:

- `node-pty`, `@parcel/watcher`, `msgpackr-extract` and `esbuild` each
  resolve their native binary through a platform-gated **optional
  dependency package** (e.g. `@esbuild/linux-x64`,
  `@parcel/watcher-linux-x64-glibc`) that Yarn Classic already installs
  for the matching host — the same mechanism `@vscode/ripgrep` uses (see
  below). Their own `install`/`postinstall` script is a fallback path for
  when no prebuilt platform package matches; it never runs here because
  one already did.
- `keytar` is Electron/OS-credential-store tooling; a browser-target app
  never loads it, matching Phase 1's original finding.
- `puppeteer` is `@theia/cli`'s own dependency (used by `theia test`, which
  this project never runs), and its postinstall would download a Chromium
  binary — exactly the class of unaudited network fetch `--ignore-scripts`
  exists to prevent.

Running every package's install script unaudited is unnecessary attack
surface; skipping the one script that is actually load-bearing breaks the
app at boot. Do not "simplify" this back to a bare `yarn install`.

If `yarn.lock` were absent you would drop `--frozen-lockfile`, but it is
committed, so every install reproduces the exact same tree.

**What `theia rebuild:browser` (invoked internally by `yarn build`)
actually prints, verified at 49 packages:** a single generic line, `native
node modules are already rebuilt for browser` — not a per-module skip
list. Reading `@theia/application-manager`'s `rebuild.js` explains why:
the command only does per-module work (backing up/reverting cached native
builds under a `.browser_modules` cache directory) when reverting a
previous **electron-target** rebuild. This project never builds an
electron target, so that cache is never populated and the command always
takes the trivial "already rebuilt" branch, at any package count. Correct
Phase 1's documented expectation here: the four-name list
(`native-keymap`, `find-git-repositories`, `drivelist`, `keytar`) was
never something this command literally prints for a browser-only app; it
described which native modules are *browser-inapplicable in principle*,
not the command's actual log output.

**`@vscode/ripgrep`** (first enters the tree here, via
`@theia/file-search`): at the pinned resolution (`1.18.0`) it has **no
scripts field at all**. It ships 12 `os`/`cpu`-gated platform binary
packages as `optionalDependencies` (e.g. `@vscode/ripgrep-linux-x64`), and
Yarn Classic already skips every one that doesn't match the host, so only
the matching package installs. **No install-time gate applies to
`@vscode/ripgrep`** — `--ignore-scripts` does nothing for it because there
is no script to skip. Do not add a no-op gate for it. If avoiding the
prebuilt `rg` binary blob is ever made policy, the only lever is a
post-install file swap of the resolved platform package (or the resolved
`rgPath` module output) for the Nix-store `rg` binary — `rgPath` is a
module-level constant import, not DI-injectable or preference-driven, so
there is no rebind seam. That is optional hardening, out of scope here.

**No bundled VS Code extensions.** The app ships `@theia/plugin-ext`,
`@theia/plugin-ext-vscode` and `@theia/vsx-registry` — the extension-host
machinery and the runtime installer — but no `theiaPlugins` manifest block
and no `theia download:plugins` step. A user installing extensions at
runtime through the Open VSX connection is the only plugin-acquisition
path this project needs; do not add a bundling step unless a future phase
decides to ship default extensions.

**Environment variables the `start` script sets.** `applications/browser`'s
`start` script exports two variables explicitly, rather than relying on
Theia's defaults, before invoking `theia start`:

- `VSX_REGISTRY_URL=https://open-vsx.org` — explicit so that repointing at
  PowerBrowser's own registry mirror (R9, post-4.0) is a config change, not a
  code change.
- `THEIA_CONFIG_DIR="${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/powerbrowser"`, with a
  `mkdir -p` run first — Theia never creates the config directory on this
  branch, and an absent directory leaves the config-dir file watch stuck in
  a 500 ms `fs.stat` poll loop with no hot reload (load-bearing for the
  customization layer's hot reload).

Phase 2 owns both only for `yarn watch`/`yarn start`. Phase 4's Firefox
supervisor takes over setting both permanently on the sidecar spawn.

**Measured on the reference host, re-measured at 49 packages (Phase 2 Plan
04):** a cold run (`node_modules` absent, Yarn's own package cache already
warm from repeated installs earlier this session — not a network-cold
measurement) of the full sequence above (install + drivelist rebuild +
build + boot, via `scripts/smoke-theia.sh`) took **23.4s**; a warm run
(`node_modules` present, `--frozen-lockfile`, no dependency changes)
took **18.1s**. Both numbers moved up from Phase 1's 11-package figures
(70s cold, 11.9s warm) — expected, given `@theia/plugin-ext` alone adds
roughly 38 direct dependencies to resolve, link and bundle. The cold
figure here is not directly comparable to Phase 1's: Phase 1's 70s
included real network package fetches on a cold cache, while this run's
Yarn package cache was already warm from this session's prior installs.
Treat 23.4s as a lower bound for a genuinely cold-cache cold run, not as
the number a first-time contributor should expect.

**One-pin Theia re-pin procedure (CFG-06, UPD-02).** A Theia release is
adopted by re-pinning — never by editing Theia core. The release is
declared once as `[upstreams] theia_release` in `configuration.toml`, and
`node scripts/verify-upstream-pins.mjs` proves every `@theia/*` pin in
`theia/package.json` resolutions, every member
`applications/*/package.json` and `extensions/*/package.json`, and every
resolved `@theia` tarball in `theia/yarn.lock` agrees with it. The one
known exception is `@theia/monaco-editor-core`, which tracks upstream's
own monaco line rather than the Theia release and is excluded by exact
package name in the check. No re-pin has been performed under this
procedure yet — it is proven structurally by the check's `--self-test`
(a patch-bumped member pin and a drifted lockfile stanza both go red
naming the file) and is exercised live only when an actual Theia release
demands it. Do NOT perform it speculatively: it rewrites the lockfile and
reinstalls `node_modules`, which is network and time neither a static
check nor a review needs.

```
# 1. declare the new release (exact triple, never a range):
#    edit configuration.toml -> [upstreams] theia_release = "<new-triple>"
# 2. move every @theia/* pin to the manifest pin. Inside the shell below,
#    from the repo root — the pin comes out of the manifest, so the
#    command line states no version of its own:
nix develop .#theia
NEW=$(node -p "require('./scripts/lib/toml.cjs').parse(require('fs').readFileSync('configuration.toml','utf8')).upstreams.theia_release")
node -e '
const fs = require("fs");
const pin = process.argv[1], EX = "@theia/monaco-editor-core";
const files = ["theia/package.json", ...fs.readdirSync("theia/applications").map(d => `theia/applications/${d}/package.json`), ...fs.readdirSync("theia/extensions").map(d => `theia/extensions/${d}/package.json`)];
for (const f of files) {
  const doc = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(f, "utf8"));
  let changed = false;
  for (const block of ["resolutions", "dependencies", "devDependencies", "peerDependencies", "optionalDependencies"]) {
    const deps = doc[block];
    if (deps === null || typeof deps !== "object" || Array.isArray(deps)) continue;
    for (const name of Object.keys(deps)) {
      if (name.startsWith("@theia/") && name !== EX && deps[name] !== pin) { deps[name] = pin; changed = true; }
    }
  }
  if (changed) fs.writeFileSync(f, JSON.stringify(doc, null, 2) + "\n");
  console.log((changed ? "moved " : "clean ") + f);
}
' "$NEW"
# 3. re-resolve the lockfile to the moved pins (deliberately NOT
#    --frozen-lockfile: the lock is being moved on purpose), from theia/:
cd theia
yarn install --ignore-scripts
cd ..
# 4. regenerate (the Theia pin needs no emitted fragment — package.json
#    files are committed build input, so the generator never rewrites
#    them; the check above is the enforcement) and prove agreement:
node scripts/generate.mjs
node scripts/verify-upstream-pins.mjs
node scripts/verify-upstream-pins.mjs --self-test
# 5. prove core untouched, full stages now that the fresh install exists:
bash scripts/diff-theia-core.sh
```

Expect the lock diff to show the `@theia` moves plus their transitive
consequences — a new `@theia` tarball carries its own dependency ranges,
so unrelated-looking lock lines moving with them is normal. What must
never appear in a re-pin diff: an edit under
`theia/node_modules/@theia`, a patch file touching Theia sources, a
vendored Theia monorepo, or a `--latest` float anywhere. `yarn upgrade
--latest` is specifically NOT this procedure: it resolves to whatever is
newest rather than to the declared pin, which is the unpinned behavior
the manifest exists to forbid.

## Firefox half

```
./scripts/fetch-upstream.sh
nix develop .#firefox
cd upstream
MOZCONFIG=../.mozconfig ./mach build
MOZCONFIG=../.mozconfig ./mach run
```

`scripts/fetch-upstream.sh` runs directly from the repo root — it only
needs `git`, which the host already provides, so it is not run inside
either `nix develop` shell. It is safely re-runnable: if `upstream/`
already exists at the pinned tag it no-ops instead of re-cloning.

Run `node scripts/generate.mjs` before `./mach configure`: `generated/` is gitignored, and a stale or absent tree misbrands with exit 0, because `--with-branding` resolves through a symlink into it and `browser/moz.configure` includes `generated/identity.configure` through one, so configure succeeds against whatever it finds there.

**Measured on the reference host:** the clone took 438s and produced a
5.6 G `upstream/` tree (re-measured 2026-08-30 on `legion`: 677s, same
5.6 G — the size is stable, the time is network-bound). A full non-artifact
`./mach build` (the phase's acceptance proof — this is not an artifact
build, see D-11/D-12) took 3224s (~54 minutes) wall time on 16 cores /
62 GB RAM, peaking at 14 G of `objdir/`. Expect similar order-of-magnitude
numbers; do not be surprised if a first-time contributor's build takes an
hour. The resulting binary reports **`DeBIOS powerbrowser 153.1.0esr`** via
`./mach run --version` — `--version` concatenates `MOZ_APP_VENDOR` with the
app **basename** (`MOZ_APP_NAME`, the fixed lowercase platform name), not
with the display name, so `PowerBrowser` correctly does **not** appear
here. The display name is asserted on its own surfaces
(`brand-full-name`, `desktop-entry`) by
`scripts/verify-branding-identity.mjs`.

`nix develop .#firefox` supplies the entire compiler toolchain (clang,
rustc, cargo, cbindgen) matched to what nixpkgs itself builds this exact
Firefox version with — there is no separate toolchain setup step to run
before `./mach build`.

## Tiered rebuild loop (D-70, D-73)

BUILD-04 is not "run a full compile every time" — it is three tiers, each
with a distinct rebuild cost, selected by what kind of file changed. All
three timings below were **re-measured on this host (`legion`), 2026-08-22**
— none are carried over from research or from a prior phase (D-73 exists
precisely because Phase 2 once carried forward a `docs/BUILD.md` "measured"
figure that was never measured). Where a re-measured figure differs from a
number research or planning inherited, that is stated explicitly here, not
silently replaced.

### Tier 1 — no build (`./mach run`)

For any file that is a **symlink from `objdir/dist/bin` into `upstream/`** —
every `.js`, `.ftl`, and branding PNG — editing the source and re-running is
free: `./mach run` is registered `category="post-build"` and never builds.

Research recorded 7450 of 7784 `objdir/dist/bin` entries as such symlinks.
Re-measured this session (files + symlinks only, directories excluded from
both counts, via `find objdir/dist/bin -type f -o -type l` and
`find objdir/dist/bin -type l -exec readlink -f {} \;` filtered to paths
under `upstream/`): **7163 of 7766** — fewer in both the numerator and the
denominator than the inherited figure. This build actually has that ratio,
not the quoted one; the difference is plausibly the branding/pref/policy
files plans `03-01`/`03-03`/`03-05` added since research ran, but the new
count is reported as measured, not reconciled against a guess.

Verified live: edited `upstream/toolkit/components/thumbnails/PageThumbs.worker.js`
(a `.js` file `objdir/dist/bin/modules/PageThumbs.worker.js` symlinks to),
confirmed the appended line was visible through the symlink with zero build
step, then restored the file to its exact original content (`md5sum` matched
before and after the edit). Timed the tier's cost:

```
MOZCONFIG=../.mozconfig ./mach run --version
```

(run inside `nix develop .#firefox`, cwd `upstream/`) — **1.05s** wall
(mach's own per-process timer printed `0:00.73`; the wrapper's stopwatch,
which also includes shell-entry overhead, measured 1052ms). Measured 2026-08-22
on `legion`.

After restoring the edited file, `git -C upstream status --porcelain` and a
fresh `bash scripts/fetch-upstream.sh` (exit 0) confirmed the tree returned to
exactly the expected-dirt state `scripts/fetch-upstream.sh` accepts — no
residual tier-1 edit.

### Tier 2 — `./mach build faster`

For a **preprocessed frontend file** — one `moz.build` compiles via `PP_FILES`
rather than installing as a plain symlink — a build is required, but only the
fast, non-compiling `faster` tier. Forced this by updating a real preprocessed
file's modification time only, changing no content:

```
touch upstream/browser/base/content/browser.xhtml
```

(`browser/base/content/browser.xhtml`, the canonical preprocessed
browser-window document, is the file this tier is measured against.) `touch`
changes no content — `git -C upstream diff --stat -- browser/base/content/browser.xhtml`
stayed empty before and after every run below, so CLAUDE.md's
never-modify-Gecko rule is not touched by this measurement, only its
modification time is. Timed:

```
MOZCONFIG=../.mozconfig ./mach build faster
```

(inside `nix develop .#firefox`, cwd `upstream/`), run twice (re-`touch`ing
before each), since the first run after a cold objdir is not representative —
it also pays mach's own one-time "build" virtualenv-site creation cost.
Invocation 1 (cold, includes that one-time cost): mach-reported wall time 20s.
Invocation 2 (warm): mach-reported wall time **1.84s** (`0:01.84` marker); a
third warm run confirmed **1.83s**. Both measured 2026-08-22 on `legion`. The
warm figure — **1.84s** — is the one to use for this tier, not the 2.55s
research inherited: D-73 forbids carrying that number forward, and the two are
close but not the same measurement.

### Tier 3 — full `./mach build`

Trigger: a change to a **compiled define** — in this repo that means editing
`patches/010-powerbrowser-identity.patch` (the one Gecko patch hunk this phase
carries) or adding a `--with-*`/`--enable-*` option to `.mozconfig`. Neither
happened as part of this measurement task; the phase's build budget is
exactly two full builds, both already spent by the two compiled-define
changes below, harvested here rather than re-run:

Every row names the tree it was measured on. Rows #1 and #2 predate the
rename and were measured on the **upstream project's tree**; row #3 is the
first full build of the **Power Browser** tree. Mixing the three under one
heading without that attribution would read as three measurements of the same
thing, which they are not.

| Build | Tree / host | Command | Wall time | sccache hit rate | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| #1 (dev, `objdir/`) | pre-rename tree, `legion`, 2026-08-21 | `MOZCONFIG=../.mozconfig ./mach build` | **2368s (~39m28s)** | not recoverable — the sccache server that ran this build had already recycled by the time its stats were checked in the same session (`03-01-SUMMARY.md`, "Issues Encountered") | `03-01-SUMMARY.md` |
| #2 (release, `objdir-release/`) | pre-rename tree, `legion`, 2026-08-21 | `POWERBROWSER_OBJDIR=objdir-release POWERBROWSER_BRANDING=powerbrowser/branding/release MOZCONFIG=../.mozconfig ./mach build` | **2822s (~47m2s)** | **0.14%** — 5648 new sccache requests this build's delta, 5043 executed, 7 hits, 5022 misses | `03-05-SUMMARY.md` |
| #3 (dev, `objdir/`) | **Power Browser tree**, `legion`, 2026-08-30 | `scripts/smoke-firefox.sh` (which runs `MOZCONFIG=../.mozconfig ./mach build`) | **2830s (~47m11s)** | not sampled — the build ran under `scripts/smoke-firefox.sh`, which does not capture `sccache --show-stats`; the near-zero hit rate measured for #2 is the expectation for this class of change | `01-04-SUMMARY.md` |

Builds #1 and #2 are not re-run — doing so would spend two more full compiles
for figures that would not differ; both are taken verbatim, with their exact
commands, from the SUMMARY that actually ran them. Build #3 is this repo's own
first full compile, from a `scripts/fetch-upstream.sh` clone (677s, 5.6 G) with
both patches applied. The **release** variant was deliberately **not** re-built
after the rename: nothing in this phase needs a second objdir, and row #2's
figure already bounds it.

### The three tiers, at a glance

| Tier | Example file in this tree | Command | Measured cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 — no build | `objdir/dist/bin/modules/PageThumbs.worker.js` (symlink into `upstream/toolkit/components/thumbnails/PageThumbs.worker.js`) | `MOZCONFIG=../.mozconfig ./mach run --version` | 1.05s (2026-08-22, `legion`) |
| 2 — `./mach build faster` | `upstream/browser/base/content/browser.xhtml` (preprocessed) | `MOZCONFIG=../.mozconfig ./mach build faster` | 1.84s warm (2026-08-22, `legion`) |
| 3 — full `./mach build` | `patches/010-powerbrowser-identity.patch` (or any `--with-*`/`--enable-*` `.mozconfig` option) | `MOZCONFIG=../.mozconfig ./mach build` | 2368s / 2822s (2026-08-21, `legion`) |

**A file that is neither symlinked into `dist/bin` nor preprocessed falls
through to tier 3** — a full `./mach build` — because there is no faster path
the build system exposes for it; the tier a file belongs to is a property of
how `moz.build` installs it (`FINAL_TARGET_FILES` symlink vs. `PP_FILES`
preprocessing vs. a compiled source the linker consumes), not a menu choice.

**Accepted cost, per D-70:** a clean clone has no minutes-to-runnable path —
the first build is always a full compile (tier 3, ~54 minutes per the
original research estimate; this phase's own two full builds ran 2368s and
2822s). Artifact builds cannot produce a renamed binary (C-1: `MOZ_APP_NAME`
is a compiled define and the Taskcluster job configuration hardcodes
`product="firefox"`), so there is no faster path to a first, PowerBrowser-branded
binary than tier 3.

## The compiled-file boundary (D-72)

`scripts/check-patch-surface.sh` is the single source of truth for which file
types a patch in `patches/*.patch` may touch. It rejects any patch whose
target path ends in one of the compiled suffixes drawn from
`upstream/python/mozbuild/mozbuild/frontend/emitter.py:1126-1133` — `.c .cc
.cxx .cpp .h .hh .hpp .inc .m .mm .rs .s .S .asm .webidl .idl .ipdl .ipdlh`,
plus any `Cargo.*` file — reading each patch's own `+++ b/` header lines, never
grepping the patch body (a body-grep would false-match a string that merely
appears inside changed content).

Two invocations:

```
bash scripts/check-patch-surface.sh              # scans patches/, exits 1 on any offense
bash scripts/check-patch-surface.sh --self-test   # plants a throwaway compiled-file patch in a mktemp dir and asserts it IS rejected
```

**Tier consequence:** a patch that touches a compiled file means every
subsequent rebuild is tier 3 (a full `./mach build`, ~2368-2822s measured
above) — there is no tier-1/tier-2 path for a change the linker has to see.
This is the entire reason the phase's one Gecko patch
(`patches/010-powerbrowser-identity.patch`) is confined to a single hunk in
`browser/moz.configure`, a config file, not a compiled source.

Deliberately **not created**: `powerbrowser/ARTIFACT-BOUNDARY.md` (the name
presumes artifact builds, which D-70 replaced with the tiered loop — this
section of `docs/BUILD.md` is the boundary's home instead) and
`powerbrowser/INTERNAL-APIS.md` (that catalogues `PowerBrowserAPI.sys.mjs`
touchpoints, none of which exist until Phase 4).

## Endpoints and the one carve-out (D-83–D-88)

`powerbrowser/endpoint-allowlist.json` is the single machine-readable source of
truth for every host and pref this build's network/telemetry surface is
allowed to touch, read directly by `scripts/verify-endpoints.sh`'s layers 1
and 3. Any host observed at runtime absent from this file, or any host in it
with disposition `deny`, is a failure — Mozilla or not (D-85).

**The one carve-out, stated plainly:** `firefox.settings.services.mozilla.com`
(Remote Settings) stays on. Its polling cadence is
`services.settings.poll_interval` = **86400 seconds (24 hours)**
(`modules/libpref/init/all.js:1745`) — not the shorter, sometimes-quoted
figure of 21600 seconds, which belongs to `app.normandy.run_interval_seconds`,
a subsystem this phase compiles out (`imply_option("MOZ_NORMANDY", False)`)
and is therefore moot. The reason
Remote Settings cannot simply be turned off: `services/settings/Utils.sys.mjs:52-84`
refuses any `services.settings.server` override off Nightly, and the only
alternative, the `DisableRemoteSettingsAndAcceptSecurityConsequences` policy,
also stops CRLite certificate-revocation data, intermediate-certificate
preloading, and tracking-protection list updates — unacceptable on a substrate
whose entire pitch is that it is a real browser.

Every host in `powerbrowser/endpoint-allowlist.json` with disposition `allow`,
and why:

| Host | Reason |
|---|---|
| `firefox.settings.services.mozilla.com` | D-83: Remote Settings, the carve-out above |
| `content-signature-2.cdn.mozilla.net` | D-83, same feature: content-signature certificate-chain verification for Remote Settings collections |
| `firefox-settings-attachments.cdn.mozilla.net` | D-83, same feature: Remote Settings' attachment CDN (CRLite's own data, one of D-83's own reasons to keep Remote Settings on) |
| `edgedl.me.gvt1.com` | D-86: Google's Widevine CDM download host — DRM stays working, no Mozilla host involved; `media.eme.enabled` defaults false on Linux so this costs nothing unattended |
| `safebrowsing.google.com` | D-85: Google Safe Browsing v2 API — deliberate waiver, malware/phishing protection stays on |
| `safebrowsing.googleapis.com` | D-85: Google Safe Browsing v4 API — same waiver as v2 |
| `update.googleapis.com` | D-86 extension: Widevine's Chromium-Omaha update-check host, fired by the same periodic AddonManager timer regardless of `media.eme.enabled` — corrects C-4's premise that Widevine is fully idle-gated (it is idle-gated for the EME-toggle path, not this periodic path) |
| `www.google.com` | D-86 extension: the Omaha check's own redirect target, observed immediately after `update.googleapis.com` in the same session |
| `dl.google.com` | D-86 extension: a second real redirect target in the same Widevine Omaha update-check flow, surfaced during this plan's own phase-gate close-out run — the redirect response names a different Google-owned download host between runs; same waiver category as `www.google.com`, not a new concern |

The three proof layers and their positive-control forms:

```
bash scripts/verify-endpoints.sh --layer 1                     # static pref grep
bash scripts/verify-endpoints.sh --layer 1 --positive-control   # restores a stock URL, must go red

bash scripts/verify-endpoints.sh --layer 2                     # exact-path strace on $HOME/.mozilla/firefox
bash scripts/verify-endpoints.sh --layer 2 --positive-control   # sandboxed $HOME with a real .mozilla/firefox dir, must go red

bash scripts/verify-endpoints.sh --layer 3 --positive-control   # re-enables OpenH264, must go red
```

`distribution/policies.json` install command, verbatim as run in
`03-03-SUMMARY.md` (a full rebuild does not produce this file, and a clobbered
objdir loses it — it must be re-copied after any clobber):

mkdir -p objdir/dist/bin/distribution
cp powerbrowser/distribution/policies.json objdir/dist/bin/distribution/policies.json
```

## Telling a dev build from a release build (BRAND-06)

What a person actually sees, side by side on a real desktop session: the dev
variant paints a real window title bar, reading the page title followed by
the suffixed brand name from its own `brand.ftl` (`... — PowerBrowser Dev`); the
release variant paints no title bar at all and keeps drawing tabs-in-titlebar
(client-side decorations), the same as it always did.

The two variants diverge in exactly three places:

1. `configure.sh`'s `MOZ_APP_DISPLAYNAME` (dev: "PowerBrowser Dev", release:
   "PowerBrowser") — this was already correct and machine-verified before this
   gap closed; it was never the problem.
2. The `brand.ftl` / `brand.properties` pair, per variant. `brand.ftl`'s
   `-brand-full-name` already diverged correctly; `brand.properties`'s
   `brandFullName` did not (03-REVIEW.md WR-01) — both now read the same
   suffixed/unsuffixed value within each variant.
3. The dev-only `browser.tabs.inTitlebar` default (`powerbrowser/branding/dev/
   pref/firefox-branding.js`, value `0`) — the release tree carries no such
   default, and that absence is what makes the two variants differ in window
   shape, not just in string content.

The icon sets also still differ (dev's `default*.png` carry a small
corner-badge overlay the release set does not), but the badge alone was
found insufficient for at-a-glance distinguishability on 2026-08-22 (a few
pixels at 16-32px) — this gap closure did not re-badge the icons; it added
the title-bar divergence as the primary, unambiguous cue instead.

`verify-platform.sh`'s `branding-variant-divergence` check is the
machine gate for both of the divergences this fix added (properties string,
titlebar default); its self-test proves it goes red if either is removed.
It cannot verify the perceptual claim itself — "tellable apart at a
glance" is a human judgment, recorded in `03-MANUAL-VERIFICATION.md`.

`branding-variant-divergence` reads the installed `brand.properties` and
`firefox-branding.js` under both `objdir/dist/bin/...` and
`objdir-release/dist/bin/...`, so it needs a full dev build **and** a full
release build (`POWERBROWSER_OBJDIR=objdir-release ... ./mach build`, Tier 3)
already in place — it runs only under `verify-platform.sh`'s full
mode, never under `--quick`. `--quick` still runs the check's self-test
(synthetic temp files, no build required).

All of these files (`brand.properties`, `firefox-branding.js`) are symlinked
into `dist/bin` (D-70 tier 1), so editing them and re-running needs no
rebuild.

## Packaging procedure (PKG-01/PKG-02, 08-04)

Self-hosted MAR updates (unsigned, HTTPS-only interim — see the
key-custody rung below), plus the Nix-built Windows
installer. Proven on Linux; MSIX and DMG need real hosts (08-05); the
production signing story is out of phase (test-sign only here, RESEARCH
open question 1).

### Key-custody rung (T-08-04a)

HTTPS-only interim (no code signature verified):

- MARs are built with the tree's own `mar` binary from an updater-enabled
  build. `--enable-unverified-updates` (`.mozconfig`, commit `28f52c7`)
  drops the Mozilla-key hard requirement — and with it every signature
  check: the MAR signature and MAR-channel checks sit inside
  `#ifdef MOZ_VERIFY_MAR_SIGNATURE` (08-04 deviation-4 evidence,
  `updater.cpp:3063, 3329`), so no signature of any key is verified and
  no fork key was generated. The MARs are unsigned, hash-pinned blobs.
- Update descriptors are generated by `buildUpdateXml` in
  `scripts/verify-mar-update-hop.mjs` straight from the MAR bytes
  (sha512 plus size) and served over HTTPS in production — but the pin
  lives inside `update.xml`, fetched over the same TLS channel as the
  MAR, so it adds no MITM resistance beyond TLS. Effective
  update-channel integrity is TLS to `updates.powerbrowser.org` only.
  The local proof serves over plain HTTP on loopback only.
- A full key-ceremony design (fork NSS key embedded vs hash-pinned
  manifests) is out of scope — RESEARCH open question 2.

### Updater enablement

`.mozconfig` carries `ac_add_options --enable-unverified-updates` as an
emitter literal (no `[build]` table — platform policy, identical for every
downstream). Any mozconfig flag change is a tier-3 rebuild. After
building, assert the updater compiled in before any MAR test runs
(Pitfall 2):

```
test -x objdir/dist/bin/updater && echo UPDATER_PRESENT
```

`config.status` carries the flag. No `upstream/` edit and no new Gecko
patch accompany the flip.

Two baked-in facts the procedure works around rather than edits:

- `application.ini`'s `[AppUpdate]` URL bakes `aus5.mozilla.org`
  (`MOZ_APPUPDATE_HOST` default in `upstream/build/moz.build:95`; no
  `option(env=...)` binding exists upstream, so no mozconfig lever can
  change it). It is NEVER used when the `AppUpdateURL` enterprise policy
  is present — `getUpdateURL` prefers the policy
  (`UpdateService.sys.mjs:5466`). A policy-less install therefore phones
  Mozilla and fails `verify-endpoints.sh` layer 3 red on `aus5` by
  design (fail-loud, observed live 08-04) — never silently green.
- `app.update.url` as a pref does not exist (removed in Bug 1568994; the
  removal is noted in `upstream/browser/app/profile/firefox.js:156`), so
  no pref file can carry the fork URL. The policy file is the only
  mechanism.

### Policy install (REQUIRED post-build step)

`powerbrowser/distribution/policies.json` carries the fork descriptor URL
plus the two telemetry/studies disables. `DisableAppUpdate` was removed
in 08-04 — it contradicted a self-updating client. A full rebuild does
not produce the installed copy, and a clobbered objdir loses it:

```
mkdir -p objdir/dist/bin/distribution
cp powerbrowser/distribution/policies.json objdir/dist/bin/distribution/policies.json
```

(This extends the 03-03 command with the `mkdir -p` the original assumed.)
Layer 3 passes with the fork policy installed (the fork host is an
allowlisted `allow`: the project's own update service) and fails without
it — both directions observed live in 08-04.

### MAR build and serve loop (the N to N-plus-1 proof)

Prerequisites: the task-1 rebuilt tree is version N
(`objdir/dist/bin/application.ini`: `Version=153.1.0`); the N-plus-1
sources are `powerbrowser/packaging/version-nplus1/` (test-only fork
version `153.1.1` / `153.1.1esr` — NOT an upstream ESR tag; the file
shapes match `upstream/browser/config/version*.txt` byte for byte except
the version string). All commands below run inside `nix develop
.#firefox` with cwd `upstream/` unless stated.

1. Build N-plus-1 in a SEPARATE objdir (never reuse N's — the proof needs
   two distinct builds). The version bump rides the supported
   `--with-version-file-path` configure lever (absolute path reads
   outside topsrcdir; `upstream/build/moz.configure/init.configure`
   milestone function), via scratch mozconfig `.mozbuild/nplus1.mozconfig`
   (untracked by design — absolute paths are host-specific; it mirrors
   the tracked `.mozconfig` plus the one flag):

   ```
   ./mach build   # with MOZCONFIG=../.mozbuild/nplus1.mozconfig
   ```

   `objdir-nplus1/` is `.gitignore`'d spill (D-01). Confirm the payload
   version: `objdir-nplus1/dist/bin/application.ini` must read
   `Version=153.1.1` with a build ID distinct from N's (build IDs derive
   from build time, so two builds always differ).

2. Package each build and stamp the precomplete file (upstream docs flow;
   the fork's staged app dir is `dist/powerbrowser`, not `dist/firefox`):

   ```
   ./mach package
   touch "<objdir>/dist/powerbrowser/precomplete"
   ```

   (`mach package` on this tree already emits `precomplete` and the
   `updater` binary into the staged dir — observed live 08-04 — so the
   touch is a docs-parity no-op, kept so the procedure matches upstream's
   verbatim. A `powerbrowser-*.tar.xz` beside the staged dir is the
   expected side product. Packaging needs the repo-root `defs.mk`
   (08-04, PKG-02): without that one-line `XPI_ROOT_APPID` mapping the
   branding locales fail with "XPI_ROOT_APPID is not defined".)

3. Emit the N-plus-1 MAR. `/bin/bash` does not exist on NixOS, so invoke
   the script through `bash` explicitly (its shebang is `/bin/bash`):

   ```
   MAR="<objdir-nplus1>/dist/host/bin/mar" MOZ_PRODUCT_VERSION=153.1.1 MAR_CHANNEL_ID=default \
     bash tools/update-packaging/make_full_update.sh <out>/nplus1.mar "<objdir-nplus1>/dist/powerbrowser"
   ```

   `MAR_CHANNEL_ID=default` matches the builds' `MOZ_UPDATE_CHANNEL`
   (`default` — `objdir/config.status`) for the day signatures return.
   Under `--enable-unverified-updates` the updater skips the whole
   `MOZ_VERIFY_MAR_SIGNATURE` block (`updater.cpp`: signature, MAR-channel
   match, and version-downgrade checks all sit inside that ifdef), so the
   live gates are the CLIENT-side newness refusal
   (`updateIsAtLeastAsOldAsCurrentVersion` in `UpdateService.sys.mjs` —
   same version plus same build ID is never offered, which is why the
   proof requires two distinct versions AND build IDs) and the download
   hash check against the descriptor's sha512. Real channel IDs
   (`MAR_CHANNEL_ID` / `ACCEPTED_MAR_CHANNEL_IDS` configure env, baked
   into `update-settings.ini`) ride along with the production-signing
   phase that re-enables signature verification — setting them now would
   cost a rebuild for a file nothing reads yet. `MOZ_PRODUCT_VERSION`
   must equal the N-plus-1 payload version the previous step baked
   (the updater stamps it into the MAR product-info block).

4. Write the served descriptor with the gate's own generator (never by
   hand) and serve descriptor plus MAR over loopback, capturing the
   access log (cwd repo root; the script carries an import guard so the
   generator is importable without running the gate):

   ```
   node --input-type=module -e "
   import { readFileSync, writeFileSync } from 'node:fs';
   import { buildUpdateXml } from './scripts/verify-mar-update-hop.mjs';
   const marBytes = readFileSync('.mozbuild/mar-hop/nplus1.mar');
   const pv = readFileSync('upstream/config/milestone.txt', 'utf8').trim().split('\n').pop();
   writeFileSync('.mozbuild/mar-hop/serve/update.xml', buildUpdateXml({ marBytes,
     marUrl: 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/nplus1.mar', appVersion: '<N+1 version>',
     platformVersion: pv, buildID: '<N+1 buildID>', displayVersion: '<N+1 display>' }));
   "
   cp .mozbuild/mar-hop/nplus1.mar .mozbuild/mar-hop/serve/nplus1.mar
   python3 -m http.server 8000 --directory .mozbuild/mar-hop/serve 2> .mozbuild/mar-hop/server-access.log &
   ```

   (The 08-04 proof used `appVersion 153.1.1`, `platformVersion 153.1.0`
   from `upstream/config/milestone.txt`, `buildID 20260904191328`,
   `displayVersion 153.1.1esr` from the N+1 `config.status`.)

   The descriptor carries sha512 plus size of the MAR bytes; regenerating
   it from identical bytes is byte-identical (no timestamps or nonces —
   PKG-02/idempotency, asserted in the gate by generating twice).

5. Stage the N test install: copy the packaged N tree to a writable
   proof dir (never update the build tree in place — further incremental
   builds would break and a clobber would be needed), install a test
   `distribution/policies.json` pointing `AppUpdateURL` at the loopback
   descriptor, and drive one hop headless through the client's own
   scheduled background-update timer (NOT `--backgroundtask
   backgroundupdate`: `MOZ_UPDATE_AGENT` exists only on Windows/macOS per
   `upstream/build/moz.configure/update-programs.configure`, so that task
   is unregistered on Linux — verified live 08-04 — and a Marionette
   session crashes registering the fork shell window, which has no
   tabBrowser):

   ```
   # test profile prefs: app.update.background.force=true (bypasses the
   # install preconditions), app.update.log=true, app.update.interval=60
   # (a fresh profile fires the due update-timer soon after startup),
   # services.settings.server="" (see the resolver-log note below)
   MOZ_REMOTE_SETTINGS_DEVTOOLS=1 MOZ_LOG=nsHostResolver:5 \
     MOZ_LOG_FILE=<proof>/client \
     LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<install-n> \
     <install-n>/powerbrowser --profile <test-profile> about:blank
   ```

   `MOZ_REMOTE_SETTINGS_DEVTOOLS=1` lets the blank settings-server pref
   take effect, silencing Remote Settings (and its content-signature /
   attachments `*.mozilla.net` callouts) so the resolver log isolates
   the update path — test-profile-only, shipped behavior unchanged.
   `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<install-n>` compensates a Nix dev-shell artifact:
   the `updater` RUNPATH names a nonexistent `outputs/out/lib` and
   carries no app-dir entry, so without it the loader fails on
   `libnspr4.so` (observed live); `nsUpdateDriver` `execv()`s the
   updater, which inherits this environ. The 08-04 run is scripted as
   `.mozbuild/mar-hop/drive-hop.py` (untracked proof tooling, like
   `nplus1.mozconfig`).

   What a cycle looks like: the due timer fires, the client fetches the
   descriptor and the MAR from loopback (hash/size verified), the
   staging updater extracts into `<install-n>/updated/` and writes
   `applied`, and the swap into place happens at the next startup via
   the replace invocation. The `pending` window is seconds wide (fast
   loopback + immediate self-restart), so poll `application.ini` for
   the flip rather than the status file. Then record `hop.json` (read
   post-hop `Version`/`BuildID` from the file, never invented) plus
   both logs under `.mozbuild/mar-hop/` per the gate's evidence
   contract. The 08-04 evidence: N `153.1.0`/`20260904184538` to N+1
   `153.1.1`/`20260904191328`, server log with descriptor plus MAR
   GETs, resolver log with zero `*.mozilla.org` / `*.mozilla.net`
   (only `update.googleapis.com`, Safe Browsing).

6. Prove it: `node scripts/verify-mar-update-hop.mjs` (row
   `mar-update-hop`). It requires two distinct versions AND build IDs (a
   same-version loop fails as plumbing-only), the served descriptor
   byte-identical to a fresh emission, fork-server access entries for
   descriptor and MAR, and zero `*.mozilla.org` / `*.mozilla.net` hosts
   in the sifted resolver log.

### NSIS-on-Nix path (PKG-01)

`nix shell nixpkgs#nsis --command makensis -VERSION` gives `3.12`. The
pinned `upstream/browser/installer/windows/nsis/installer.nsi` compiles
on the Linux host with the generated `branding.nsi` (six defines,
canonical values) — the 08-04 spike refuted the hypothesized Windows-only
plugin blocker: NSIS plugins execute on the install target, never in the
makensis process, so the compiler only embeds the plugin DLLs already
checked into `upstream/other-licenses/nsis/Plugins/`.

Row: `scripts/verify-platform.sh --only installer-build-proof` (needs
makensis via the nix shell, python3, a `generated/` tree and a built
objdir — all fail-loud). It stages the pinned inputs from the tree at
check time (real installer scripts, toolkit files, plugin DLLs, the real
generated branding.nsi, `defines.nsi` preprocessed with check-time
values, locales through the real `preprocess-locale.py`), compiles, and
requires `setup.exe`.

Stand-ins that stay labeled, never blessed (08-05 work): the wizard
bitmaps (`wizHeader.bmp`, `wizHeaderRTL.bmp`, `wizWatermark.bmp`),
`firefox64.ico` and `stubinstaller/` artwork come from
`upstream/browser/branding/unofficial/` — the fork ships no wizard
artwork yet; and `defines.nsi` still carries upstream's own Mozilla
literals (`AppName`, certificate names, Mozilla telemetry URL) that a
Windows shippable must replace. The row's PASS line says the compile
only.

### Packaging hosts (08-05): capability record

One row per host. Every later task cites its host by name; no artifact work
starts on an unnamed host. MSIX and DMG are never attempted on Linux: the
pinned tree's own tooling is the authority — `msix.py` raises without
`makeappx.exe`/`signtool.exe` from the Windows SDK, and `dmg.py` shells out
to macOS-only `hdiutil`/`SetFile`.

Numbered versions on `staged-unexecuted` rows are the REQUIRED spec (floor),
not observations: the exact media, OS, and SDK builds are recorded here at
provision time. Observed facts carry their evidence inline.

| Host | OS / toolchain (numbered) | makensis | State | Evidence / unblock |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| nix-linux (legion) | NixOS 26.05.8954 (Yarara), x86_64, `nix develop .#firefox` toolchain per toolchain-baseline.txt | makensis 3.12 (`nix shell nixpkgs#nsis --command makensis -VERSION` gives `v3.12`, re-verified 2026-09-05) | reachable | Proof: 08-04 `installer-build-proof` PASS — the pinned installer.nsi compiled with the generated branding.nsi into setup.exe in 3.4s |
| pkg-win11 | Windows 11 23H2+ install media (required) + Windows SDK 10.0 with makeappx.exe and signtool.exe via WINDOWSSDKDIR or PATH (required) + NSIS 3.12 (required) | n/a until provisioned (Windows-side NSIS after the guest exists) | staged-unexecuted | Provisioning error (observed 2026-09-05): `sudo -n true` fails (`sudo: a password is required`), so qemu:///system is unmanageable — no domain can be defined, no NAT network created, and the root-owned `/var/lib/libvirt/images/win11.qcow2` is unreadable; `virsh list --all` shows zero defined domains; that qcow2 is 200704 bytes (a fresh-image stub, no installed guest OS); no guest agent, no guest credentials, and no Windows SDK/NSIS on any reachable guest exist. Media present and verified listable: `win11-install.iso` (8471603200 bytes, UDF volume `CCCOMA_X64FRE_EN-US_DV9`, 2026-03-07) with EFI boot plus `sources/install.wim` (7.5 GB) plus `sources/setup.exe`, and `virtio-win.iso` (1435727872 bytes), both 2026-07-29. A genuine MSIX proof additionally needs a full Windows Gecko build (multi-hour Windows compile) that no host can run yet. Unblock (operator, needs privilege): create the libvirt NAT network, define the pkg-win11 domain from the verified media above, run an unattended install, install the QEMU guest agent plus Windows SDK 10.0 plus NSIS 3.12, build the Windows dist, then hand the agent guest access — or provision any Windows 11 host with SDK plus NSIS and name it pkg-win11. Dependent cells (Windows MSIX build, Windows install/launch/uninstall/no-residue, Windows N to N-plus-1 hop, Windows alongside-stock-Firefox) stay staged-unexecuted until then. |
| pkg-macos | macOS 14+ with Xcode command-line tools (required; hdiutil and SetFile are system tools) | n/a (no NSIS role on macOS) | staged-unexecuted | Provisioning error (observed 2026-09-05): no macOS install image exists anywhere reachable — `/var/lib/libvirt/images/` holds only the Windows media and stub above, and a filesystem-wide `*.dmg` search returns nothing; no Apple hardware; no lawful download path for a macOS image from Linux. Unblock (operator): provision a real Mac (or lawful macOS VM) with Xcode command-line tools, build the macOS dist on it, and hand the agent access as pkg-macos. Dependent cells (DMG build, macOS install/launch/uninstall/no-residue, macOS N to N-plus-1 hop, macOS alongside-stock-Firefox) stay staged-unexecuted until then. |

Test-signing posture (T-08-05a, accepted): when the staged hosts provision,
matrix proofs run test-signed (`signtool` test cert on pkg-win11, ad-hoc
`codesign` on pkg-macos) with the expected SmartScreen and Gatekeeper
friction documented per cell. Production certificate procurement is a later
decision per RESEARCH open question 1 and is NOT procured in this phase.

### MSIX / DMG mechanics (for the staged hosts)

- MSIX: `upstream/python/mozbuild/mozbuild/repackaging/msix.py`
  raises without `makeappx.exe`/`signtool.exe` from the Windows SDK —
  a real Windows host/VM, no Linux fallback.
- DMG: `upstream/python/mozbuild/mozpack/dmg.py` shells out to
  macOS-only `hdiutil`/`SetFile` — a real macOS host/VM.
- The per-OS install → launch → uninstall → no-residue matrix, plus the
  alongside-stock-Firefox interleaved launch, run there (matrix section
  below records the Linux cells green and the staged cells with unblocks).

### Per-OS install matrix with update hops (08-05)

Rows `installer-build-proof` and `mar-update-hop` both re-run PASS on the
current tree 2026-09-05 (nix-linux). The Linux cells below ran live the same
day via `.mozbuild/matrix/run-matrix.sh` (untracked proof tooling, same
standing as `drive-hop.py`); Windows and macOS cells are staged-unexecuted
per the capability record above, never green without their logs.

| OS / host | install | launch | alongside stock Firefox | uninstall + no-residue | N to N-plus-1 hop |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Linux / nix-linux | GREEN: packaged `powerbrowser-153.1.0.en-US.linux-x86_64.tar.xz` extracted to a test prefix; fork `distribution/policies.json` installed per the post-build step; staged `application.ini` reads `Vendor=DeBIOS`, `Name=powerbrowser`, `Version=153.1.0`, `BuildID=20260904184538` | GREEN: staged binary alive 25s headless (`MOZ_HEADLESS=1 --profile <test> --no-remote about:blank` inside `nix develop .#firefox`) | GREEN: stock firefox (system 155.0) wrote a 20146-byte headless screenshot while the fork build stayed alive — distinct binaries, profiles, and frozen remoting names (`powerbrowser` vs `firefox`), no profile or remoting collision | GREEN: prefix plus both test profiles removed; `ls ~` before/after diff empty; no `~/.powerbrowser`, no `~/.mozilla` | GREEN: N `153.1.0`/`20260904184538` to N-plus-1 `153.1.1`/`20260904191328`, result `applied` (hop.json); descriptor `update.xml` hash-pinned sha512 `d1184023cbab2e8dc587f7238e890a93cda8f1078bb87284f84c252908c0ec6fb4e2c31106b86ba01171b3637bc7b80a0b38c997de373fe1f4a4ec972c41a3a0` (full value in `.mozbuild/mar-hop/serve/update.xml`), size 78654141; fork-server access log shows the descriptor plus MAR GETs over loopback; client resolver log sifted to zero `*.mozilla.org` / `*.mozilla.net` (only Safe Browsing `update.googleapis.com`) — zero-Mozilla-host proof |
| Windows 11 / pkg-win11 | staged-unexecuted | staged-unexecuted | staged-unexecuted (must prove no collision against stock Firefox with the frozen remoting and window-class pins) | staged-unexecuted (must include the no-residue check after uninstall) | staged-unexecuted (must cite two distinct versions and build IDs plus fork-server log entries) — unblock for the whole row: capability record above |
| macOS / pkg-macos | staged-unexecuted | staged-unexecuted | staged-unexecuted | staged-unexecuted | staged-unexecuted — unblock for the whole row: capability record above |

Two harness faults found and fixed while driving the Linux cells (test-side
only, no product change): the driver first leaked the fork-prefix
`LD_LIBRARY_PATH` into the stock-firefox invocation (stock `libxul.so`
refused the fork `libnss3.so` with `NSS_3.126 not found`) — the stock launch
now runs under `env -u LD_LIBRARY_PATH`; and stock firefox 155 requires a
pre-created `--profile` dir (`Could not find profile folder`) — both test
profiles are now pre-created. The reds were read directly off the failing
invocations, not asserted from absence.

### Packaging timings (attributed: tree plus host plus toolchain)

| Build / step | Tree | Host / toolchain | Wall |
|---|---|---|---|
| Updater-flag-flip rebuild (`objdir/`, incremental after reconfigure) | Power Browser post-rename, 08-04 task 1 | legion, `nix develop .#firefox` | 33m44s (mach wall clock `.mozbuild/task1-updater-rebuild.log`) |
| N-plus-1 fresh build (`objdir-nplus1/`, separate objdir) | same plus test version files | legion, `nix develop .#firefox` | 54m (mach wall 54:28, `.mozbuild/task2-nplus1-build.log`; 18:19→19:13 wall — a full tier-3 despite sccache, since the version bump recompiles version-stamped objects) |
| `installer.nsi` compile via makensis 3.12 | Power Browser @ 08-04 spike stage | legion, `nix shell nixpkgs#nsis` | 3.4s |

## Rebase procedure and desktop install (D-74, D-77)

One documented command moves the fork onto a new ESR tag:

```
scripts/rebase-upstream.sh --tag <NEW_TAG> [--dry-run]
```

It fails loudly, by name, at any of: the requested tag not existing on the
remote (checked via `git ls-remote` before any clone), `fetch-upstream.sh`
failing to re-materialize `upstream/` at the new tag,
`apply-patches.sh` failing to replay `patches/*.patch` (including D-75's
non-vacuous per-patch assertion — a patch that applies as a silent no-op is a
failure, by name), `check-patch-surface.sh` rejecting the replayed stack, the
residual-brand scan finding a brand string in either tree it now reads — this
repo's own tracked files, and, via `--extra-root "$UPSTREAM_DIR"`, the rebased
`upstream/` checkout that `.gitignore` keeps out of `git ls-files` and that the
replay has just rewritten (an absent or empty extra root is itself a failure,
never a skip) — or the git-excluded branding-overlay symlink
(`upstream/powerbrowser`) failing to resolve back to this repo's
`powerbrowser/` directory after the rebase.

**Live drill (08-05, UPD-03).** Ran for real against
`FIREFOX_153_2_0esr_RELEASE` — the newest tag in the 153 ESR series newer
than the pinned `FIREFOX_153_1_0esr_RELEASE` (155/156 tags are different
release trains, out of scope for this drill). Result: PASS —
`rebase-upstream.sh` re-materialized upstream/, replayed the patch stack
verified non-vacuous, `check-patch-surface.sh` accepted it, the
residual-brand scan passed over 146 tracked files plus 460674 files under
`--extra-root upstream/`, the classifier reported fully-applied with dirt
matching the patch stack exactly, the branding overlay resolved, and
`installer-schema` passed over the rebased tree. The PITFALLS #2 operator
follow-up ran clean: `toolchain-baseline.sh` output diffed empty against
the committed baseline (no FFI drift at the new tag). Full log:
`.mozbuild/rebase-drill-0805.log` (untracked proof artifact).
The tree was then restored to the pinned tag through the same tooling
(`fetch-upstream.sh` at the manifest pin plus `apply-patches.sh`), so the
pin, the tree, and every phase proof agree: drills rehearse, pins decide.
Adopting 153.2.0esr is a future rebase-adoption task (pin move plus full
tier-3 rebuilds), not part of this drill.

**CI story:** `.github/workflows/rebase-upstream.yml` is `workflow_dispatch`-only
(no `schedule:` — the ~4-weekly ESR cadence is a standing post-v4.0 operational
item, not a Phase 3 deliverable) and runs the same replay off this machine, on
a GitHub-hosted runner. **Nix and the Gecko build are deliberately out of
scope for this workflow**: the Nix Gecko toolchain closure does not fit a
standard GitHub-hosted runner alongside a multi-gigabyte Gecko working tree,
so the workflow only exercises `rebase-upstream.sh`'s clone/replay/verify
sequence — it never runs `./mach build`. Consequently, the
`scripts/toolchain-baseline.sh` diff against the committed
`toolchain-baseline.txt` that PITFALLS #2 requires after every ESR rebase is a
**local operator follow-up**, run under `nix develop .#firefox` after a
successful CI replay — not a CI step, because the toolchain that produces it
only exists in the `firefox` devShell this workflow does not enter.

**Desktop install (local dev testing).** `powerbrowser/powerbrowser.desktop` (dev)
and `powerbrowser/powerbrowser-release.desktop` (release) install at the user-scope
path:

```
~/.local/share/applications/powerbrowser.desktop
~/.local/share/applications/powerbrowser-release.desktop
```

Both `Exec=` and `Icon=` in each file carry the placeholder
`@POWERBROWSER_REPO_ROOT@` instead of an absolute path, so the tracked files
are identical at every checkout and the byte-identity gate stays green on a
fresh clone. Substitute the placeholder with this checkout's absolute path
before installing:

```
sed "s|@POWERBROWSER_REPO_ROOT@|$PWD|g" powerbrowser/powerbrowser.desktop > ~/.local/share/applications/powerbrowser.desktop
sed "s|@POWERBROWSER_REPO_ROOT@|$PWD|g" powerbrowser/powerbrowser-release.desktop > ~/.local/share/applications/powerbrowser-release.desktop
```

After any later change to either file's `Exec=` or `StartupWMClass=`, re-register
with:

```
update-desktop-database ~/.local/share/applications
```

`update-desktop-database` is **not currently installed on this host** — that
follow-up needs the package (nixpkgs `desktop-file-utils`) added to a dev
shell before it can be run; neither `.desktop` file has been installed here
yet, so this has not blocked anything so far.

## Toolchain baseline

Phase 3's rebase procedure (BUILD-03) starts by diffing the toolchain the
`firefox` shell resolves today against the committed baseline:

```
diff <(nix develop .#firefox --command bash scripts/toolchain-baseline.sh) toolchain-baseline.txt
```

A non-empty diff means the pinned `nixpkgs` revision now resolves to a
different `rustc`, `cargo`, or `cbindgen` version than the committed
`toolchain-baseline.txt` — the FFI-drift signal the project's pitfalls
research calls out as something to re-check on every ESR rebase, not just
once. To regenerate the baseline file itself (only do this deliberately,
as part of a reviewed rebase):

```
nix develop .#firefox --command bash scripts/toolchain-baseline.sh > toolchain-baseline.txt
```

## Verifying a fresh clone

This is the check that proves the commands above are complete — that
nothing in them depends on tribal knowledge left over in a working tree
that has been iterated on directly.

```
git clone . <fresh-space-free-path>
cd <fresh-space-free-path>
./scripts/fetch-upstream.sh
./scripts/smoke-theia.sh
nix develop .#firefox --command bash -c 'cd upstream && MOZCONFIG=../.mozconfig ./mach configure'
diff <(nix develop .#firefox --command bash scripts/toolchain-baseline.sh) toolchain-baseline.txt
```

The Firefox step above uses `./mach configure` as a **fast proxy**, not as
an equivalent. Configure covers most of the toolchain-detection path
(rustc, cargo, cbindgen, the WASM-sandboxing opt-out, libclang discovery)
in about a minute, so it is the right routine check.

Be clear about what it does not cover. Of the three toolchain defects
found while building this phase, one — nixpkgs' bintools-wrapper
exporting `AS`/`LD`/etc., which broke `moz.configure`'s assembler flag
routing — surfaced only **during compilation**, on the first `.s` file
(NSPR's `os_Linux_x86_64.s`), long after configure had succeeded. A
configure-only check would have passed straight over it. Treat a green
configure as "the documented setup is probably complete", not as proof
that a fresh clone builds.

The full check has been run once, end to end, on a genuinely fresh clone:

```
git clone . <fresh-space-free-path>
cd <fresh-space-free-path>
./scripts/fetch-upstream.sh                                     # 554s, 5.6G
./scripts/smoke-theia.sh                                        # 14s, PASS
nix develop .#firefox --command bash -c 'cd upstream && MOZCONFIG=../.mozconfig ./mach build'
```

Result: exit 0 in 3641s (~61 min), 14G objdir, zero `mach bootstrap`
invocations, `objdir/dist/bin/firefox --version` reporting
`Mozilla Firefox 153.1.0esr`, and `git status` clean in both the repo and
`upstream/`. Re-run the full build rather than just configure whenever
anything in `flake.nix`, `.mozconfig`, or the toolchain pin changes.

Any command that a fresh clone needs but this document does not list is
treated as a documentation failure, not a footnote — it gets added here
and re-verified, not just noted in a summary.
