/**
 * GUI-06 (13-03): the chrome bar's keybindings.
 *
 * One binding only: focusing the address pill. `ctrlcmd` is the stock Theia
 * spelling for "Ctrl on Linux/Windows, Cmd on macOS" -- registering the two
 * modifiers as two literal bindings does NOT do that, because Theia rejects
 * a literal `cmd+` binding off macOS ("meta is for OSX only") and logs a
 * startup warning, leaving the macOS half unregistered on every other
 * platform. Bound against the imported focus-command const -- never a
 * re-spelled id string. Bound statically at module load beside the plan
 * 13-02 bindings (D-50: a contribution bound after first enumeration is
 * permanently invisible).
