/**
 * GUI-07: the tab strip's Browsing home — the very top of the window, above
 * the URL row, where Firefox and Chrome put it (14-UI-SPEC per-mode shell map,
 * amended 2026-09-08; sketch 003).
 *
 * ## Why this is a second view and not the strip itself moved
 *
 * The stock strip is a Lumino `TabBar` owned by the main `DockPanel`. It is
 * `position: absolute` with left/top/width the dock's layout recomputes on
 * every pass (measured live: `top: 0; left: 0; width: 1609px; height: 35px`
 * inside `#theia-main-content-panel`). Reparenting that node into the top
 * panel does not move a widget between shell areas the way 13-01's spike
 * moved a content widget — it hands one node to two layouts, and the dock
 * wins every pass. So the top-panel home renders the same model instead, and
 * the dock's own bar is hidden while this one is showing.
 *
 * That hiding is Lumino's own supported path, not surgery: `DockPanel` hides
 * generated tab bars itself in `single-document` mode, and the layout
 * accounts for a hidden bar. Measured live: with the dock's bar hidden the
 * current content moved from y=107 to y=72 and returned on show, so the 35px
 * is genuinely reclaimed rather than left as a gap.
 *
 * ## Why it fits without resizing anything
 *
 * The top panel is pinned at 72px — `fit()` on the panel and on the shell
 * both leave it there. It does not need to change: in Browsing the menubar
 * (30px) hides, the box layout reflows the URL row to y=0, and the freed
 * space at the bottom is where this strip goes. `[strip][URL row]` occupies
 * the same 72px `[menubar][URL row]` did.
 *
 * ## What this is NOT
 *
 * Not the unified chrome+Theia tab strip. That is GUI-04, it is a later
 * milestone by CLAUDE.md hard rule 3, and it requires the chrome-owned tab
 * model in `@powerbrowser/browser-bridge`. This widget reads Theia's main
 * dock and nothing else; it adds no tab model of its own, so it cannot
 * become a second source of truth that the bridge would later have to
 * reconcile.
