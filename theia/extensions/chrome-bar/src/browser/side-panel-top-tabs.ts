/**
 * VS Code's "activity bar at the top" for both side panels (sketch 005 item 4,
 * adopted 2026-10-17; built 2026-10-20 at Chris's request).
 *
 * Stock Theia stands a 48px vertical icon rail beside each side panel and puts
 * a title row ("EXPLORER ...") over the view. This lays the side out top to
 * bottom instead: one header row holding the view icons, left to right, with
 * the view's own actions at its right end, and the view below. The rail's foot
 * menus are not placed at all -- the gear and the account button live in the
 * title row (LayoutControlsWidget), as in VS Code.
 *
 * A collapsed side is hidden outright, not shrunk to a rail: with no rail
 * there is nothing to show. The layout toggles reopen it.
 *
 * Theia allows exactly this through DI: the shell builds each side with
 * whatever `SidePanelHandler` is bound, so no core file changes.
