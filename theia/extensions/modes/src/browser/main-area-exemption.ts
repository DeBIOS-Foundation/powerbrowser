/**
 * GUI-07: the main-area exemption at the perspective deactivate seam.
 *
 * 14-UI-SPEC.md:223 and :232-233 contract that content tabs never unmount,
 * close, move windows, or detach on a mode switch. Stock Theia breaks that on
 * the SECOND and later visit to a mode, and the whole failure lives inside
 * @theia/core -- hard rule 1 forbids editing it, so this file reshapes the
 * DATA stock reads rather than the code that reads it.
 *
 * The stock sequence (@theia/core/lib/browser/perspective-service.js,
 * doSwitchPerspective):
 *
 *     :122-124  oldPerspective.onDeactivate(shell)            <- this seam
 *     :126      savedLayouts.set(oldId, shell.getLayoutData())
 *     :131      const savedLayout = savedLayouts.get(targetId)
 *     :135      await shell.setLayoutData(savedLayout)        <- destructive
 *     :136      detachStrayWidgets(layoutWidgetIds)
 *
 * setLayoutData reaches application-shell.js:727
 * `if (mainPanel) { this.mainPanel.restoreLayout(mainPanel) }`, and Lumino's
 * restoreLayout unparents every widget absent from the restored config. So a
 * mode's second visit restores a snapshot taken before today's tabs existed
 * and unparents every tab opened since. The teardown is CONDITIONAL on the
 * target already having a saved layout, which is exactly why a first visit
 * looks clean and the bug reads as intermittent. Snapshots survive relaunch
 * through ShellLayoutRestorer, so it survives a restart too.
 *
 * One seam, not one call site: onDeactivate fires BEFORE both the save at :126
 * and the read at :131, and inside the `switchInProgress` lock, so stripping
 * the main-area and bottom-area keys out of every saved layout here covers
 * every switch path -- the toggle, the stock perspective picker, setups
 * restore, launch -- without any of them knowing this file exists.
 *
 * Stripping works because stock's own guards are key-PRESENCE guards:
 * application-shell.js:702 `if (bottomPanel.config)` and :727 `if (mainPanel)`.
 * An absent key means Lumino's unparenting loop is never entered and the live
 * main area is left exactly as it is. Side panels keep restoring normally --
 * reshaping those is what a mode is for.
 *
 * The bottom panel is deleted whole rather than by its `config` key alone,
 * because `bottomPanel.expanded` (application-shell.js:708) and
 * `bottomPanel.pinned` (:715) are read OUTSIDE the config guard: keeping the
 * key would expand or collapse the panel from a stale flag and re-pin the LIVE
 * bottom widgets positionally against a stale pinned array. Modes assert
 * bottom-panel visibility themselves on every switch, so nothing is lost.
 *
 * The keep-set hazard, and why the repair below exists: stock derives
 * `layoutWidgetIds` from the SAME layout object (collectWidgetIds
 * :325-339, which walks mainPanel.main at :333-338), and detachStrayWidgets
 * (:364-376) unparents every LEFT/RIGHT dock widget whose id is missing from
 * that set. Clearing mainPanel therefore SHRINKS the set. A widget that is
 * side-docked right now but named in the target's stale main config used to
 * survive by being moved into the main area; with the main config gone it is
 * neither moved nor protected, so stock would newly unparent it. That is the
 * one behaviour this exemption would otherwise regress, and `afterSwitch`
 * re-docks exactly those widgets and nothing else. No other widget loses
 * protection: side-panel restore is purely additive (side-panel-handler.js
 * :229-262 adds a tab per item and removes none), so the left/right halves of
 * the keep-set are untouched by the strip.
 */

/**
 * The dock-config shape stock's own collectDockWidgetIds walks
 * (perspective-service.js:350-363). Declared structurally rather than imported
 * from Lumino: both arms are optional here, so one walk covers `tab-area` and
 * `split-area` without repeating stock's type discriminant.
