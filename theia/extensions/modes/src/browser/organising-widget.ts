/**
 * GUI-08 (15-01): the tracer Panorama organising widget.
 *
 * Plain-Widget (placeholder idiom -- NOT React; drag needs direct DOM
 * transforms) owning the organising slot behind the same
 * `registerOrganisingSlot` seam. Canvas and tree are two render roots over
 * the ONE GroupModel: flipping the toggle never reloads and never loses
 * selection. The 144px tray is always rendered as the stable ungrouping
 * drop target.
 *
 * Tracer slice ONLY: New Group, header-drag move (150ms-debounced persist
 * with pointerup commit), card dive, last-card-out dissolve. No corner
 * resize, no auto-box on drop, no close-through-tabs beyond the contracted
 * dialog (those are 15-02). Zoom is a pure view transform here -- card data
 * and box bounds are untouched, nothing persists.
 *
 * 15-02: full canvas geometry. Corner resize (16x16 handle, 200x144 live
 * floor, same debounce/commit discipline), the four-gesture auto-box drop
 * matrix (card-onto-card, card-onto-field, card-into-box, card-into-tray)
 * with optimistic paint and contracted rollback, Esc cancelling any geometry
 * gesture with paint reverted and no further persist, dragged-card 0.7 with
 * no transition while dragging, accent target outline (reserved use 7).
 * Card drags ride native HTML5 DnD, so an Esc-cancelled drag fires no drop
 * and persists nothing by construction -- there is no mid-drag paint to
 * revert. Zoom stays a pure view transform: bounds plus card data untouched,
 * thumbnails scaling by CSS, never re-captured.
 *
 * Copy: contracted 15-UI-SPEC.md strings verbatim; no placeholder copy
 * survives. Names render as textContent, never innerHTML.

     * dead press -- no band, no capture, no listeners, and nothing on screen

     * guard returned BEFORE `preventDefault`, so Gecko went on to do its
     * ordinary focus fixup, focus left the name field, `blur` fired `commit`,
     * and `commit` cleared the flag. Press one paid for press two. And since
     * press two drew a group, it re-armed the flag -- so the toll was charged
     * again on every group, forever.
     *
     * Committing here rather than relying on that accident matters now that
     * these gestures call `preventDefault`: preventing the default is exactly
     * what suppresses the focus fixup, so removing the guard alone would have
     * left the name field open and the typed name unsaved.

     * `setPointerCapture` and have always worked here. Cards now use the same
