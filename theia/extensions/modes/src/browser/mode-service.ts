/**
 * GUI-07 (14-02): custom modes as user-storage data over the shipped defaults.
 *
 * Schema (resolves 14-RESEARCH.md Open Question 2, modes half): the customs
 * file holds an object with a numeric version plus a customs array whose rows
 * carry a name and side-panel visibility flags. A row once also carried a
 * NG-035: a row also carries `furniture` and `views` (which views sit in which side area); both are optional, so a file written before them still loads and the version did not move. Shipped modes resolve to the same shape through SHIPPED_MODE_RULES.
 * Validation is hand-rolled total parsing: unknown fields are dropped, rows
 * with an unusable name are dropped silently, rows with a readable name but
 * unreadable fields are dropped with the contracted fallback notice naming
 * them, and a wholly unreadable file falls back to shipped Browsing with the
 * contracted notice (naming the last-good active custom when one is known,
 * resetting silently otherwise) -- never a blank shell, never a throw during
 * startup (T-14-02-01).
 *
 * Lifecycle (customize-css precedent): absence is the default and is never
 * created; the first read runs fire-and-forget after startup (awaiting a
 * user-storage read inside onStart re-enters the documented boot-chain
 * deadlock); later read failures keep last-good content; DELETED resets
 * immediately; other changes reload through the in-tree 150ms debounce, and
 * the persisted active custom id is re-applied after registration so a custom
 * mode survives relaunch (14-RESEARCH.md Pitfall 3). Stock PerspectiveService
 * exposes no unregister, so a custom deleted mid-session keeps its descriptor
 * until relaunch: the service drops it from every listing and falls back to
 * Browsing when stuck on it, and the stale toggle row clears on relaunch.
 *
 * Save path (14-PATTERNS.md section 3): the typed name is trimmed and cut at
 * the contracted 60-character cap before commit; the contracted empty-name
 * and duplicate-name errors write nothing partial; success flashes the
 * contracted saved confirmation and lands in the new mode (whose stock switch
 * event repaints the toggle). A custom never alters a shipped default in
 * place: shipped-colliding names are duplicates. Names render as text with
 * ellipsis plus tooltip at the toggle (T-14-02-02).
 *
 * The switch path (activateMode) is the allowlisted surface the
 * switch-invariant gate derives at check time: stock perspective switching,
 * side-panel expand and collapse, contribution-routed placeholder open and
 * close through the descriptor slot seam, and -- via the widget's
 * publishTabCount on the same stock event -- the chip re-assertion. No switch
 * path closes, moves, or detaches a tab (T-14-02-04). The one addition is
 * ensureInArea, which DOCKS the Explorer before expanding it: stock's
 * `expand(id)` is a pure find over widgets already in the dock, so with the
 * view absent it returned undefined having done nothing, and Coding showed no
 * Theia view at all. Adding a widget is additive by construction -- it cannot
 * detach one.
