# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-09-05)

**Core value:** A stranger can clone Power Browser, edit `configuration.toml`, drop in a logo, and build their own branded, working web browser without touching any other file — then reshape its GUI through Theia extensions without forking the platform.
**Current focus:** v1.2 Sign-off Closeout and SQL Store — Phases 10 (sign-off closeout), 11 (SQL store design), 12 (SQL store build). No GUI work this cycle.

## Current Position

Phase: 12 (SQL Store Build) — Phases 10-11 implementation complete, verifications deferred per nonstop rule
Plan: —
Status: Phases 10-11 executed, advancing to Phase 12
Last activity: 2026-09-05 — Phase 11 executed (3/3 plans, review clean after fixes, verification deferred)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Phase 08]: Self-hosted MAR rung is HTTPS-only interim — docs claim only TLS until fork-signing lands
- [Phase 08]: NSIS builds on Nix (makensis 3.12); MSIX/DMG staged with operator unblocks (no sudo for libvirt, no macOS image)
- [Phase 08]: WR-04 guard strips `$$` pairs then rejects survivors; BiDi self-test uses INVOKED_DIRECTLY guard

- [Roadmap]: Phase 1 ships with no generator — hand-written branding literals — so Phase 2's acceptance test is byte-identical generated output
- [Roadmap]: GUI requirements (GUI-01..04) fold into Phase 1; the customize bridge and browser toggle already exist in sourcerer, so their v1 requirement is surviving the migration as platform features
- [Roadmap]: Telemetry, extensions, and Theia branding consolidate into one Theia-surface phase (Phase 4) rather than three thin phases
- [Research]: `[telemetry] send-to-theia` replaced by Theia's real enum (off/crash/error/all) + endpoint — Theia ships no destination, Power Browser implements the only one
- [Research]: Identity/legal keys hard-fail with no code-level default; cosmetic keys default with a visible echo
- [Phase ?]: Inventory format is JSON (D-15 left it open) — zero dependencies, both consumers are Node
- [Phase ?]: The 01-01 tracer renames CONTENT only; every file/directory git mv stays in plan 01-02 per D-06
- [Phase ?]: MOZ_APP_BASENAME takes the one-word lowercase identifier 'powerbrowser' (D-10), so --with-app-basename and verify-branding-identity.mjs's application.ini expectation are class 'identity' and move together
- [Phase ?]: Per-site token classification uses file-scoped 'only_in' rows with context-anchored tokens in preference to line-pinned site_overrides
- [Phase ?]: Reconciliation condition 4 and the ground-truth check both use detectors independent of the boundary matcher, so the scan cannot pass by agreeing with itself (T-01-04)
- [Phase ?]: The D-18 gate excepts hand-write SITES not a class — the outstanding set spans brand-display (Pitfall 1) and brand-identifier (Pitfall 4), so no class exception can express the 01-03 hand-off
- [Phase ?]: The npm scope is one indivisible contract group — yarn install proved customize/package.json cannot be staged apart from its sibling dependency
- [Phase ?]: theia/yarn.lock needs no regeneration: yarn v1 never records workspace-local packages in the lock
- [Phase ?]: 01-03: D-18 gate carve-out dropped — bare scan-brand-residue exits 0, so --except-hand-write excepts nothing and is removed from both call sites
- [Phase ?]: 01-03: verify-branding-preflight.mjs derives expectations from a new inventory brand_display_expectations block, not from verify-branding-identity.mjs — the rename had written PowerBrowser Dev into that verifier's own expectation
- [Phase ?]: 01-03: the pre-rename census stays HISTORICAL, not rewritten — an all-zeros post-rename census is a vacuous duplicate of the plain gate and destroys the red-scan evidence
- [Phase ?]: 01-03: four per-phase drivers consolidated into scripts/verify-platform.sh; 45 labels ported with parity asserted programmatically before git rm
- [Phase ?]: 01-03: placeholder mark is the IEC 60417-5009 power glyph — a standard symbol, so non-derivation is answerable rather than a matter of opinion
- [Phase ?]: 01-04: patch chain proof runs against a blob-PRUNED pristine upstream/, not a second 5.6 GB clone -- git apply --3way writes its own post-image blob, so an unpruned re-test passes vacuously
- [Phase ?]: 01-04: theia/yarn.lock needs no regeneration -- yarn v1 records no workspace-local package, so the @powerbrowser scope rename left it byte-identical
- [Phase ?]: 01-04: MIG-04 closed on artifact evidence (smoke-firefox + smoke-theia PASS, six identity surfaces green with the runtime-identity positive control), not on plan frontmatter
- [Phase ?]: GUI-01 ratified land-as-spiked: startup-window selection lives in the command-line handler; BROWSER_CHROME_URL keeps its stock upstream value
- [Phase ?]: GUI-01 frontend-to-chrome channel is candidate A (window.open from the Theia command handler); the JSWindowActor fallback was not taken
- [Phase ?]: User-facing error copy lives in one derivable USER_MESSAGE table; nine failure paths collapse onto four sentences because their distinctions are diagnostic, not actionable
- [Phase ?]: Diagnostics rows and the POWERBROWSER_ERROR_DIAGNOSTICS sentinel read one getFailureDetails() accessor, so the rendered surface and the machine-readable line cannot disagree
- [Phase ?]: The two objdir-release checks are named --gate exclusions keyed on ledger entry 10 rather than deleted or narrowed
- [Phase ?]: smoke-theia.sh is a registry row: the consolidated verifier is now a true superset of the validation strategy's full-suite command
- [Phase ?]: 01-08: the residual-brand gate's non-zero exit is single-sourced through gateFailures(); reconciliation failures now fail the un-flagged run every registered call site invokes
- [Phase ?]: 01-08: condition 4's unclaimed-probe walk moved above reconcile()'s post-rename early return -- a defence unreachable in the state it guards is not a defence
- [Phase ?]: 01-08: the -PLAN.md provenance count moved 21->28 by ADDITION only (+2 driver consolidation, +5 INTERNAL-APIS.md catalogue rows); the six Sourcerer-era citations are byte-identical to the census-era set
- [Phase ?]: 01-08: the preflight's display-surface set is DERIVED by walking the branding extension's browser directory at check time; a zero-file walk is its own failure, not a clean run
- [Phase ?]: 01-08: verify-branding.mjs applies one shared assertDisplayForm() to both display surfaces, reading its expected values from the inventory rather than hard-coding them
- [Phase ?]: 01-08: ledger items 15 and 16 stay OPEN -- no human was present, and no automated proxy was written for either perceptual walkthrough
- [Phase ?]: 01-09: the one-time initialisation block and _restart()'s port choice are keyed on this._swapped -- the field _swap()'s own guard reads -- so 'port pinned' and 'spawn completed' stop being one condition
- [Phase ?]: 01-09: _spawnAndGate's parameter renamed firstSpawn -> beforeFirstSwap; keeping the old name while changing its meaning would re-encode the conflation in a name
- [Phase ?]: 01-09: D-104's pinned-port respawn invariant preserved only after a completed swap -- before one, nothing is loaded at that origin, so re-pinning had no beneficiary and a real D-112 cost
- [Phase ?]: 01-09: MIG-04 NOT marked complete -- the error-affordance half of the same gap is plan 01-10, and 034f857 already reverted one premature Complete
- [Phase ?]: 01-10: one public terminal handler (reportUnexpectedFailure) with four attachment points -- four promise roots have no shared root to guard, but there is exactly one place the outcome is decided
- [Phase ?]: 01-10: the two long-lived supervisor loops were attached too, a strict superset of the gap's missing: list -- same defect class, and leaving them would keep the bug alive on the path a mid-session outage takes
- [Phase ?]: 01-10: no USER_MESSAGE entry minted (4 before, 4 after) -- declared/referenced equality means a new key must be referenced, which for a generic backstop means inventing a distinction the user cannot act on
- [Phase ?]: 01-10: the leftover-reap site is guarded but deliberately NON-FATAL, a reasoned deviation from missing: item 3 -- failing a launch over a previous launch's stale pid would turn a cosmetic cleanup miss into the dead screen the guard exists to prevent
- [Phase ?]: 01-10: the session-cookie catch RETURNS before the navigation, so a launch whose credential was never minted never reaches the backend origin (T-01-08)
- [Phase ?]: 01-10: the terminal-handler coverage rule derives both sets from the tree (async declarations; bootstrap calls under the derived binding name) and treats an empty derivation as its own failure -- a rule with no call sites asserts nothing
- [Phase ?]: 01-11: the error-state clear lives in retry(), not _restart() -- _restart() is also the recovery probe's re-entry point and _hideError() stops that probe, so clearing there would tear down the loop calling it
- [Phase ?]: 01-11: the analyzer EVALUATES both shipped files (ChromeUtils-faked import + node:vm sandbox that is its own window) rather than re-implementing either; the drive is the bootstrap's own DOMContentLoaded handler
- [Phase ?]: 01-11: deriveErrorLayerBinding tries the SHOW global before the HIDE global -- deriving only from hide made the plan's own removal-side fault a derivation dead-end instead of a set-equality red
- [Phase ?]: 01-11: WINDOWS.md ledger item 15 stays OPEN -- a Node-level contract check over shipped source is not a human clicking Retry in a real window
- [Phase ?]: The recovery-probe gate is the recoverable flag _showError already receives, not a new sidecar-resolved boolean: a second source of truth for one fact is the defect's shape, not its fix
- [Phase ?]: A two-directional gate needs a registered positive control with its own planted fault, or 'stop doing X everywhere' passes the negative half
- [Phase ?]: Probe instrumentation is causal (spawns after the code-under-test's own error sentinel), not temporal: an immediately-resolving fake sleep makes the probe a pure microtask loop the harness cannot interleave with
- [Phase ?]: Refusal lives in TheiaService.retry(), not in the DOM — powerbrowserRetry() is a window global any chrome-privileged caller can invoke, so a rendered state is presentation and never authority
- [Phase ?]: The retry guard returns before _hideError(), so a refused click cannot null _failureDetails and erase the rows that identified the failure
- [Phase ?]: two-consecutive-failing-retries-repaint retargeted onto the recoverable class rather than retired; the unrecoverable class moved to the new scenario, and the two assert the gate in both directions
- [Phase ?]: Minted USER_MESSAGE.couldNotStartUnrecoverable where 01-10 declined to mint a key: here the distinction IS the action, because one screen offers Retry and the other does not
- [Phase ?]: POWERBROWSER_DECK_STATE gained no key for the Retry control's visibility — the named place a future tier-3 launch-level check would add one, rather than scaffolding for a check nobody is writing
- [Phase ?]: 01-14: rule (4)'s accept set is DERIVED from two initializer shapes (object literal; this.<method>() return carrying a declared USER_MESSAGE key) -- a name list could only ever agree with the tree it was copied from
- [Phase ?]: 01-14: catchParamNames is file-scoped and never widens the accept set -- it only selects which rejection message prints, so block-scope tracking would buy a parser the check does not need
- [Phase ?]: 01-14: a method whose every return sets message: null does NOT qualify as message-bearing -- a binding that always paints nothing is a different defect, not a licence
- [Phase ?]: 01-14: each new fault row is proven GREEN under a scratch copy of the pre-fix checker and RED under the fixed one -- a row red under both is not evidence that the named hole was closed
- [Phase ?]: 01-14: the 01-UI-SPEC provenance entry is prose, not a table row -- the file's 104-row count and the corrected row's identifying string are both grep-asserted, so a row would have broken two acceptance criteria
- [Phase ?]: 01-15: the extra-root pass runs offences and unclaimed probes but NOT reconcile()/groundTruth() -- D-17's census counts this repo's own migrating tree and cannot close over a foreign checkout
- [Phase ?]: 01-15: one inScanScope() predicate, two file-set sources (git ls-files; a caller-supplied root) -- the extra root is add-alongside, never a second weaker ruleset
- [Phase ?]: 01-15: symlinks are skipped structurally -- upstream/powerbrowser links back into this repo's powerbrowser/, so a link-following walk would rescan this tree through a second path
- [Phase ?]: 01-15 [Rule 2]: an unrecognized argument now exits 2 -- the pre-fix script dropped unknown flags silently, so a mistyped --extra-root reported PASS over 109 tracked files, CR-B's own failure class one keystroke away
- [Phase ?]: 01-15: the backstop truth was MEASURED, not deferred -- 55s over 463,930 files against the live 5.6 GB upstream/, exit 0, upstream diff empty afterwards
- [Phase ?]: 01-16: the _showError enumeration regex stays byte-identical; the deliverable is an equality assertion against an independently derived call-site total, not a wider pattern
- [Phase ?]: 01-16: messageBearingBindings shape (a) tests message: at depth 0 only — a nested message: means <binding>.message is undefined at runtime
- [Phase ?]: The --extra-root residual-brand pass filters the coincidental class out of its row set and only that class; frozen rows stay applicable in a Gecko checkout.
- [Phase ?]: scan() records unreadable files; the policy is per-caller — any unreadable file fails under --extra-root, any non-ENOENT reason fails over the tracked tree, ENOENT keeps its documented allowance.
- [Phase ?]: The chmod-000 self-test row fails loudly when it cannot establish its precondition; --self-test run as root goes red on that row by design.
- [Phase ?]: 01-18: About-dialog stock link rows are suppressed by branding CSS (#communityDesc, #contributeDesc, #bottomBox > hbox), not deleted from the DOM — no Gecko patch; deletion is a follow-up only if UAT rejects hidden-not-removed
- [Phase ?]: 01-18: the wordmark-positioning block is removed from both branding aboutDialog.css files because about-wordmark.svg is unshipped; Phase 3's icon pipeline restores it with the asset
- [Phase ?]: 01-18: branding chrome-resource packaging completeness is asserted from a directory read at check time in three directions (unpackaged resource, missing source, variant divergence), riding the two branding-preflight rows already in --quick
- [Phase ?]: 01-19: the shell chrome document's <title> is the single literal Gecko hands the window manager — no runtime writer on the chain, so one edit is the whole title-bar fix
- [Phase ?]: 01-19: the preflight's shell-markup surface set is derived from powerbrowser/shell/jar.mn at check time and restricted to .xhtml/.html, because packaged .js/.mjs prose comments legitimately spell the identifier form
- [Phase ?]: 01-19: a stale expectation inside a checker is the same defect class as a leaking shipped literal and is fixed in the same plan, not deferred
- [Phase ?]: About-dialog debranding suppresses the two mozilla.org bottom links by href prefix, not the whole container, so the internal about:license disclosure survives; about:credits stays suppressed as vendor content.
- [Phase 01]: 01-21: About-dialog link coverage is evaluated PER STYLESHEET VARIANT, not over a union of both — a union passes a link covered in dev but not release, and has no file to name in the failure
- [Phase 01]: 01-21: #communityExperimentalDesc was SUPPRESSED, not exempted (WR-08) — an exemption list inside a gate is a hand-kept expectation that can only agree with the tree it was copied from
- [Phase 01]: 01-21: the derived external-link set carries no host filter, so an ESR rebase adding a link to a NEW host goes red through the same comparison
- [Phase 01]: 01-21: DISCLOSURE_HREF (must-survive, singular) stays add-alongside the derived must-be-suppressed set — opposite polarity, and merging them requires the allow/deny table the plan forbids
- [Phase ?]: The mark's rebrand-surface home is brand/mark.svg; the ten PNG rasters stay under powerbrowser/branding/{dev,release}/ until Phase 3's icon pipeline (D-16)
- [Phase ?]: verify-branding-preflight.mjs keeps deriving expected values from inventory/brand-tokens.json's hand-authored brand_display_expectations, never from configuration.toml — that independence is what stops the gate being a tautology (T-02-05)
- [Phase ?]: smol-toml 1.8.0 is vendored as a single self-contained CJS file, not npm-pinned: pinning would require npm ci before verify-platform.sh --quick could run at all
- [Phase ?]: identity.display_name lives in the required (and therefore masked) [identity] table, so a downstream that omits it hard-fails rather than silently inheriting Power Browser's mark
- [Phase ?]: The generator rejects unknown settings before any assignment; output paths come only from a frozen target array, never from a manifest value
- [Phase 02]: Power Browser is its own downstream: the root configuration.toml is split along the mask line — optional keys are the defaults layer, required keys are the downstream layer — so byte-identity survives the merge and the project's own build exercises the same merge path a downstream will
- [Phase 02]: The merge returns its own provenance (the defaulted dotted paths) rather than a later traversal re-deriving it; the echo sorts and prints that array
- [Phase 02]: Arrays are leaves to both the masker and the merge: a downstream array replaces the default array so a downstream can drop an entry (D-07), pinned by the 'downstream array shorter than default' self-test case
- [Phase ?]: The frozen target table holds string literals for both the generated and the tracked path of all five surfaces; a variant contributes objdir and branding_dir as emitted CONTENT only, so no config key can direct a write (GEN-04, T-02-02)
- [Phase ?]: One emitter per file FORMAT parameterised by variant, not one per output file — the dev/release differences are entirely the variant's name_suffix, and a second emitter is how two files that must differ in one line drift in others
- [Phase ?]: The check mode emits into a unique mkdtemp removed in a finally and never writes under generated/; it reports fresh, stale, absent and leftover as four distinct outcomes, with set equality run in both directions so a removed emitter cannot leave its output behind
- [Phase 02]: 02-05: the byte-identity gate emits into mkdtemp and compares against the TRACKED files, never git-ignored generated/ — a gate red on a fresh clone for a non-defect is a gate its readers learn to skip
- [Phase 02]: 02-05: git check-ignore must be asked about 'generated/' with the trailing slash; .gitignore's directory-only pattern does not match a bare path when the directory is absent
- [Phase 02]: 02-05: CFG-01 marked complete — 02-04 deferred it pending this plan's registry row, which is now green
- [Phase 02]: checkTargets took a root parameter rather than the self-test re-implementing the comparison — two comparison paths would let the proved thing and the run thing drift
- [Phase 02]: The no-internals copy rule is a predicate applied to every self-test case's output inside the loop, not a tenth case — a case could only ever check its own fixture
- [Phase 02]: The malformed-manifest case runs in a child process, because an unparseable layer exits from inside loadLayer and would take the self-test down with it
- [Phase 02]: generate-check asserts idempotence and nothing more; the CI steps run generate, then --check, then byte-identity, because generated/ is git-ignored and a fresh clone would otherwise show five phantom stale paths
- [Phase 02]: The configure.sh header rewrite (D-03 step 2) was made only after the byte-identity row was recorded green against the original bytes at 94c47d1, and the emitter plus both tracked files changed in one commit
- [Phase 03]: [03-01]: --with-branding outside topsrcdir rejected by moz.build sandbox; overlay symlink powerbrowser/branding-generated -> ../generated/branding with VALUE at depth 3 (branding moz.build ../../../ include pins it)
- [Phase 03]: [03-01]: mozconfig exports satisfy MOZ_APP_VENDOR/UA_NAME with zero diff -- identity carrier is exports, no generated configure include
- [Phase 03]: [03-01]: aboutDialog.css and pref/firefox-branding.js emitted as literals (base plus dev-only tail) so generated/branding/<variant> is a complete drop-in dir
- [Phase 03]: [03-01]: agreement checker SKIPs on absent generated/ tree, FAILs on present-but-empty (fresh-clone greenness preserved per 02-06)
- [Phase 03]: [03-01]: overlay symlink is setup-created by ensure_branding_overlay, not committed (tracked symlink breaks residue scan with EISDIR)
- [Phase 03]: [03-01]: GEN-01 left open -- identity.configure plus tier-3 build are 03-04 scope; default-env build red until 03-02 lands PNGs
- [Phase 03]: [Phase 03]: 03-02 icon pipeline closed on landed commits 633976e/83646b1/e66f59c — stale resume state expected only task 1 done, so tasks 2-3 were adopted via full re-verification rather than duplicate commits
- [Phase 03]: [03-04]: identity carrier is a generated imply_option fragment (generated/identity.configure) pulled in by patch 010's include hook, NOT mozconfig exports -- project_flag() pins possible_origins to (implied,) and a forced configure rejects environment-origin exports live (03-01 spike conclusion corrected)
- [Phase 03]: [03-04]: proof-only tasks commit nothing (03-01 tracer precedent); Zebra-excursion and tier-3 outcomes live in 03-04-SUMMARY.md, not in empty commits
- [Phase 03]: [03-04]: release tree still never built -- full-suite release rows fail pre-existing (documented since 03-01); tier-3 proof is dev-variant per plan
- [Phase 03]: 04-02 D-04-02-01: build downloads Theia plugins --packed (stock default decompresses, leaving no hashable artifact); side benefit is no unpinned transitive auto-resolution
- [Phase 03]: 04-02: entry-free manifest requires NO theiaPlugins block (strict), every extensions validation failure names the entry id
- [Phase 03]: 04-04: logo rides the runtime channel as SVG text (D-04-04-01); PNG rasters stay in the Phase-3 icon pipeline
- [Phase 03]: 04-04: allowlist stale direction scoped to manifest-marked entries; derivation owned by generate.mjs with the new check asserting sync (D-04-04-06/07)
- [Phase 03]: 04-04: breakpad.reportURL confirmed at upstream firefox.js:1551, always emitted blank-by-default; shipped welcome/about texts null (D-04-04-04/05)
- [Phase 04]: 05-01: MOZ_APP_ID GUID stays as untouched stock context (audit proved never patch-carried); telemetry flags relocated as fixed platform content, not manifest keys
- [Phase 04]: 05-02: ESR pin is schema-required (masked from defaults) so a downstream must state its own tag, never inherit this project's
- [Phase 04]: 05-02: tag-literal sweep shape is FIREFOX_-plus-digit; fixtures outside the checker use a shape-valid Acme pin to stay sweep-clean
- [Phase 04]: 05-03: theia_release schema-required (masked); fixture 0.0.0; generator emits nothing (GEN-04); lockfile asserts stanza version only; no new registry rows
- [Phase 04]: 05-04: real-conflict drift gets a permanent self-test case; silent-adoption and dirt classes cited from existing output, not duplicated
- [Phase 04]: 05-04: 3-way-clean context shift is correct-apply behavior; backstops are the post-replay surface, brand, and fetch re-check chain in rebase-upstream.sh
- [Phase 04]: 05-04: workflow read-through clean so task 2 commits nothing; live rebase plus tier-3 build staged as UNEXECUTED commands pending a next ESR tag
- [Phase 05]: 06-02: identity checker VARIANTS keeps structural paths only; all brand values derive from configuration.toml via resolveConfig
- [Phase 06]: 07-02: sweep exemption E1 derives rebrand-invariance per run; --all requires --fixtures-root as argv (phase path spells a residue probe)
- [Phase 06]: 07-03: harness copy-shape fix is case-insensitive matching, not a generator copy change (both casings pinned by generate self-test)
- [Phase 06]: 07-03: fail plants clone the 07-02 manifest verbatim so each fixture carries exactly one defect
- [Phase 06]: 07-04: fixtures root glob-derived in scan-scoped registry (probe-bearing phase path never spelled)
- [Phase 06]: 07-04: drill identity pairs script overrides with direct artifact asserts (application-ini/executable report rebrand delta by design)
- [Phase 10]: 10-02 sync-don't-rebuild: inert policies.json key synced byte-identical into objdirs, no tier-3 rebuild
- [Phase 10]: 10-03: re-run beats re-cite at closeout — every cited row re-executed on the final tree including full-tier drill rows
- [Phase 10]: 10-03: zero staged drills to carry — carry list is exactly the five human UAT sheets
- [Phase 10]: 11-01: no AUTHORITY.md defects in reviewer pass — six rows confirmed as written
- [Phase 10]: 11-01: assumed inputs A1-A5 deferred with pinning procedures, A6 pinned by construction

### Pending Todos

- [tooling/minor] Declare bundled WebExtensions in `configuration.toml` — EXT-02, the WebExtension sibling of EXT-01. Mechanism is platform work; the curated list stays data (REQUIREMENTS.md:243 bars the set itself from the tree). Not scheduled.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 1]: Rename blast radius — ~1,090 occurrences, 5 case forms, 6 coupled reference formats. Needs phase research + plan-review-convergence.
- [Phase 3]: `--with-branding` into a sibling `generated/` dir via symlink is architecturally sound but never executed. Also open: whether the generated-`.mozconfig` route works with `imply_option("MOZ_APP_VENDOR", ...)` dropped from the patch.
- [Phase 4]: `theia download:plugins` / Open VSX pin semantics unexercised in this tree; hash-verifiable pins unknown.
- [Phase 6]: Mozilla and Eclipse trademark findings are LOW-confidence web-sourced; re-verify against primary policy before gating.
- ~~[Spelling]~~ Resolved 2026-08-29: user confirmed "Sourcerer"; REQUIREMENTS.md and PROJECT.md normalized.
- MIG-04 is NOT complete: nothing has been built (objdir/ absent). 01-03 delivered its prerequisites only; plan 01-04 owns the build. Nine verify-platform.sh checks become runnable at that point.
- Phase 1's two manual verifications (GUI-01 browser-window toggle, 5 steps; GUI-03 visible runtime restyle, 3 steps) are UNPERFORMED -- 01-07 ran autonomously with no human. Recorded as open WINDOWS.md ledger entries.
- WINDOWS.md 18's named residual: no registered check drives a rejection out of either long-lived supervisor loop, so those two terminal handlers rest on the source-derived coverage rule rather than on a runtime red

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At |

## Deferred Verification

Standing instruction (2026-09-04, user): defer ALL verification until everything
that can be built is built. Verify only when the roadmap is fully executed or a
real problem needs human help.

Standing instruction (2026-09-04, user): every `/gsd-autonomous` run is
nonstop by default — no human until done. Pre-answered pause points:
(1) verification asking to validate → record deferred, keep going;
(2) verification gaps → one automatic gap-closure retry, then record deferred
and keep going; (3) milestone audit gaps/tech debt → accept, continue to
closeout; (4) cleanup file-deletion approval → approve after checking the
dry-run list is phase scratch only; (5) plan-phase runs with
`--no-reversibility-gates` (one-way decisions still rated, never gated). The ONLY contact is a blocker surviving
3 fix-and-retry attempts → halt `needs_human` with resume command. Rescind
with "autonomous interactive".
