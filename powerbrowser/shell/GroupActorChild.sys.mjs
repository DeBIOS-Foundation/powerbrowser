// GUI-08 (15-01): content-side half of the PowerBrowserGroup actor pair.
//
// The Theia frontend is unprivileged web content: it cannot reach the actor
// directly, so it posts PowerBrowserGroupRequest DOM events carrying
// { requestId, msg }. This child forwards each one over
// PowerBrowserGroupMutation to the parent and posts the ack back as a
// PowerBrowserGroupResponse DOM event carrying { requestId, reply }, which
// the frontend correlator matches up (5s ack timeout, then the contracted
// save-error bar).
//
// Boundary discipline (D-96): this file carries ZERO privileged reach -- no
// module import of any kind, only the actor globals plus DOM dispatch. It
// loads solely in documents matching the Theia local origin (the matches
// pin in the registration call), so stock-window web content never runs it.
//
// GUI-02 (14.1-01): the channel now runs in BOTH directions. Chrome pushes
// web-tab state (URL, title, loading, back/forward availability, and the
// reserved accel+L focus request) to the frontend as a
// PowerBrowserWebTabState actor message; receiveMessage below re-dispatches
// it into the content window as a DOM event of the same name, under the
// same content-compartment rule sendResponse already documents. The
// payload is primitives only, so the JSON round trip is lossless.

    // is how browser-window-command.ts decides between this channel and its
    // window.open fallback WITHOUT awaiting an ack. That distinction is not a
    // style choice: window.open needs the user activation of the click that
    // started the request, and an await spends it, so a fallback decided 5s
    // later is a fallback the popup blocker eats. Deliberately AFTER the
    // sendQuery above -- a synchronous throw there leaves the event
    // un-prevented, so the frontend falls back instead of opening nothing.
    // A no-op for the group mutations: GroupActorClient's events are not
    // cancelable, and preventDefault on a non-cancelable event does nothing.

    // content an object from this scope makes the frontend read it through an
    // Xray that exposes none of its own properties, so `detail.requestId` came
    // back undefined, the correlator dropped every reply as malformed, and
    // each mutation waited out its full 5s ack timeout EVEN WHEN chrome had
    // already applied the write. That was one of the faults that kept this
    // channel dead from the day it was written.
    //
    // Upstream clones this hop with the privileged clone helper
    // (WebChannelChild.sys.mjs:69, RemotePageChild.sys.mjs:103). We cannot:
    // that helper's namespace is an unconditional forbidden pattern outside
    // PowerBrowserAPI.sys.mjs (D-96, enforced by
    // scripts/check-internals-boundary.sh), and this file's whole point is
    // ZERO privileged reach. Round-tripping through the CONTENT window's own
    // JSON does the same job with no privileged API: the parse runs in that
    // compartment, so the result is a plain content object. The payload is
    // JSON-safe by construction -- requestId is a string and reply is the
    // parent's {ok, kind, ...} record of primitives.
    //
    // Through the Xray this actor holds on the window, `win.JSON` is an
    // object whose methods are NOT callable -- `win.JSON.parse is not a
    // function`, measured live by 14.1-03's web-tab check, which found that
    // every reply on this channel had thrown here and every awaited request
    // in the frontend had timed out. `wrappedJSObject` waives the Xray for
    // exactly this call, so the content window's own JSON.parse runs on a
    // primitive string and hands back a content object. That waiver is the
    // one non-Xray touch in this file: the frontend origin is already the
    // trusted party (the matches pin and the embedder-is-primary wall admit
    // nothing else), and a string in, an object out exposes nothing of this
    // scope to it.

  // reason) builds the detail -- so this file keeps zero privileged reach.
